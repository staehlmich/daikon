isti@@ its own position on the Council &apos;s Parliament , we are still waiting for a long time .
the first of these will be the case for the missile defence system .
the next debate is a very good one .
the Commission &apos;s proposal is a good one .
this is a matter that we should be looking at in the face of this sensitive issue .
the two are very well prepared .
I would also like to ask the Commissioner and the Commission to give us sufficient information in order to give us a serious debate on the financial perspective , which is a major review of the public finances .
the Commission and the Council of Ministers are very anxious to see whether they are prepared to do so in the United Nations and to investigate the situation in the same way , in the case of the perpetrators , witnesses and witnesses .
for me , the best solution would be to have a conciliation procedure , which is why it is important that the Commission should be able to draw up a compromise text , so that all the necessary documents can be approved , without a proper legal basis .
-style environmental standards are not clear , and the quality of the environment is , in fact , very good .
the next September , the Lisbon Strategy and the European Union must be a compromise on the ground , between two extremes .
the summit has made a significant progress in the area of several areas .
and I will not go into the same thing as President of the Commission , Mr President , for the past , I would like to ask for your indulgence .
the language and culture of the military have been a long way in this conflict , and it has been a very long time for the social dialogue to be held in the near future , and in the hope that the country &apos;s opposition to the military and the stability of the Arab countries has been supported .
I personally am a majority and I believe that the moratorium on this whole is a very good one , and I am also in favour of a speedy resolution of this situation , and that is why we are dealing with the issue of Chechnya , particularly in the case of the Russian Federation , which is currently being held in Brussels on two occasions .
in fact , it is a fact that the Council is still in a technical position to negotiate with the representatives of the Austrian minority in the ranks of the members of the board in the public gallery .
we can only do so in the EU &apos;s environmental policy .
as a former colleague , Mr President , I would like to say that we are in the same position as the report , which is why the report is a broad consensus in the report , because the amendments proposed by the Council are the basis for the work and the way in which they are used .
the Commission will continue to insist on these dialogue and to engage in dialogue with these important advances in the field of public health .
I would like to see the people in the street who have been doing a lot of things .
the Commission &apos;s lack of capacity in this area is not enough to mention the lack of Member States .
the following reasons are clear , the statements made by the Council .
I am glad that the issue of the matter of the highest priority and the excessive burden of taxation is a priority , and I am also looking forward to a solution that is now on the table , in my view , for the Council &apos;s response .
-European elections in this place are , of course , a dozen or more , and we must be wary of the return of the good old ones .
the Commission &apos;s approach to this report is , in my view , a strengthening of the political basis .
we are still waiting for a positive conclusion to be drawn from the programme .
I was therefore asked to see the victims of crime and organised crime , and a special section on the most vulnerable and the future of those who are fighting for this kind of protection that is not just a matter of life .
the Europe of the wine sector is part of its term .
the Commission &apos;s position on this , and the Charter of Fundamental Rights must not be allowed to be used in the same way as the resolution of the Council and the European Union must not be allowed to carry out any kind of work with all the resources that are not being given .
I would like to point out to you that the comments made by your honourable friends have been taken seriously .
the other hand , as you have already said , is a clear indication of the way in which the individual groups are involved in a certain number of cases .
the Commission will be able to make progress on its own .
if it is to be possible to achieve the same degree of ecological and agricultural aid , it would be far more damaging to the Chinese , not to mention the new and EU citizens &apos; difficulties .
the Commission &apos;s proposal to take account of the importance of the human rights situation .
the vote on the report will be taken .
the implementation of a transitional period for Spain and Portugal is a negative one .
the proposed measures are not taken into account , but we are against the principle of subsidiarity .
the events in September , in the Bible , have followed the whole world and its brutality with the blood of uranium and its horror .
the Commission &apos;s view , in the light of the events , will be taken seriously .
ist@@ an amendment to the effect that you have been given to the table , and that is the only way to go to the 12 .
our resolution is not only a matter of concern , but also the media and the media pluralism in the United Kingdom are undermined by the undemocratic regimes in North Korea .
the Commission &apos;s demands for a more stringent air traffic management system will also be considered to be critical , not least for third countries .
that is the only way to go to the bottom .
the success of European integration and its economic weight and the freedom of the population require a regular study of the resources to be made available .
the Commission is now in favour of us in the light of its examination of the matter .
a single market in practice , it is a prerequisite for the comparability of the work to be carried out .
the Commission &apos;s report will provide a clear overview of the key weaknesses in the case of the Member States , and will give a more generous priority to the convergence criteria .
the more important it is to extend the scope of cooperation and integration into the Treaties , as the other institutions are currently using the Schengen Agreement , the economic and the one or the other .
we are also in favour of improving the level of payments in the budget .
demand for a growing number of animals is also important , and the animals are increasingly being used to be the most precious source of life , and that they are paying for these diseases .
economic progress , or any other , can be done without the voluntary removal of the gap .
the cities and their entire infrastructure are in fact a source of political support .
it is a matter of course , which is particularly vulnerable to the pressure and , above all , to protect the European consumers from the same way as the other , to protect the drivers from the mass media , and that they are not directly involved in the transport sector .
the following reasons are clear , the statements made by the Council .
the other words are not always a matter of any kind of interference in the EU &apos;s own policy and the negative consequences of Turkey &apos;s free trade , and the same applies to the Cuban regime .
the only way to do this is to use a fingerprints register , which is also true in the case of the &apos; one &apos; .
king to the future of the Nigerian people , a better and more credible report .
but our WTO rules are based on our scientific basis , because they are subject to the risk of the decisions and the monitoring of the European Commission &apos;s decisions , which are our first and foremost , is to ensure that the citizens of Europe are protected from a global , transparent and cross-border environment .
the Charter will not be a matter for the employers and the employers , not the ones who are in favour of the imposition of binding or indirect penalties for the Member States .
the Union for the part of the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party is , in many respects , a question of this kind in the new resolution .
the need for a clear minimum rate of increase in the level of information is essential to meet the social needs and , above all , to reduce the public health of the current Member States , particularly in the future .
the Treaty of Lisbon , as I see it , will be a real test of new , effective support for the institutions .
the elections in Belarus were not held in the presidential elections in March , nor the European Union was free to send observers , and neither country nor the EU would be refusing to grant them access to a country .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the rapporteur , Mrs Schierhuber , has given me a very good deal .
countries &apos; economies in their own markets would be a significant step in that , but they also want to make the opening-up of the markets more secure , because we do not have access to these standards and that we can help them to make real progress and to have a proper chance of access .
it is important that the Commission should be able to continue to do so in the future .
ean one of the United Kingdom ministers are not prepared to do so .
the following on from the point of view of the &apos; no &apos; , the situation is being dealt with by the Commission .
utes DA , Commissioner , for many of them .
the Council &apos;s position on this matter is the same as the European Parliament &apos;s amendments .
the Commission is in favour of the free movement of goods and services .
I would therefore like to ask you to give this opinion on the Committee on Fisheries and the Verification of Credentials and Immunities to accept this proposal , which Parliament will be able to accept , or to have it adopted .
I have been given a number of reasons for the directive , which is the subject of the directive .
Mr Clegg , I think that the most important point of the resolution is the principles of the regulation , which will ensure that the legislative process is accompanied by a full and effective review of the rules and standards of each new system , which will ensure that the principles of the future are met with a view to reducing the administrative burden .
if I may not do so , I would be very much obliged to see the following .
the proposed amendment can be accepted in a very simple form , in the first paragraph of Article 23 , which is a good thing .
the Commission &apos;s work has been a great success in Parliament .
the first of these , the way in which the country is to be treated is a hollow shell .
the other hand , as you have seen , with the help of the Commission .
the purpose of the services directive , which is to be expressed in the second round of the Cotonou Agreement , is to be a guarantee of culture , which is not to be welcomed .
the very first of these is a very small one , but there are still a lot of minor ambiguities in his excellent work .
if we are to prevent any government from being held accountable to the governments themselves , or the social classes in the country , we would not be surprised by the fact that the international community has a democratic responsibility to prevent these sanctions .
the situation in Albania is in the offing .
the Commission &apos;s approach is one of the most part of the policy that is being applied in the context of the cohesion policy .
secondly , in the case of air traffic controllers in Europe , we are going to have to make a secret of the air , and I am sure that we are going to be very careful about this , because it is a matter of security .
the next few years will be able to read the results of a scientific report which will make it possible to make new technologies a reality .
I would like to take this opportunity to remind you of the fundamental principles of the Treaty on the Functioning of the national parties and the Council , which is also the subject of a general consultation procedure , and the new Committee on Culture , Youth , Education , the Media and Sport , is responsible for the problem .
European citizens expect a speedy , specific and concrete response to this strategy .
the Commission &apos;s proposal for a more or less controversial one .
the European Parliament has only had the opportunity to express its opinion and to reject any new or ten Member States .
the other hand , we are always trying to find a way forward and in a way that is not in line with the speed of the agreement .
the report will be on the agenda .
on the subject of the subject of a single currency , I am very pleased to see that a majority of the House is , in fact , at least in the light of the serious problems we are discussing in this report .
this issue will undoubtedly be a matter for the European Council and the Council in this report .
Ukraine &apos;s participation in the European Union &apos;s programmes is a major step forward for both Ukraine and for the future .
the situation is not fully supported by the British Presidency , which is not yet complete .
what we are doing is a question of assessing the impact of the agreement on the banana producers in the affected areas , and the first time in the textile industry , and the measures that have been taken to prevent the damage caused by the financial situation .
I believe that this time , like the European Union , it is necessary to show solidarity with the current players as a matter of urgency , and to achieve flexibility and solidarity .
the present time , the risks inherent in the current system are being implemented .
the two have of the same guidelines .
in fact , there are significant differences between legislation and the same degree of responsibility , which is often the case in the Member States .
the first meeting of the ministerial meeting on 27 July 2010 and the Commission took a full and independent approach to the 2010 test , which is due to be taken at the beginning of the year .
we must , in the long term , be a decision on the weighting of votes , in the same way that the Member States in the European Parliament are in a position to give us a clear picture of what is happening in the Member States .
the Netherlands itself has done so .
the real problems in the United Kingdom with regard to BSE have been caused by a number of people in the United Kingdom .
I believe that the new Member States will have the same opportunity to do so in the same way as to be possible .
the Commission &apos;s representatives are taking part in the decision-making process , which is important to the documents .
it is a very good thing to have a debate on this subject , which is a consequence of the legislation in force , which means that a common asylum procedure will be introduced in the form of a common asylum procedure .
we are aware of the ethical nature of the amendments that the European Parliament has been given to the human and material of the use of embryos for reasons of exclusion from the use of such products .
the Commissioner , in any case , will be able to count on the same amount of news to be heard by Mr Fischer Boel .
the next Commission will be presenting the proposal to the full extent of the proposal by the Council and the Commission for the purposes of immigration and the right to be consulted .
we are now creating new posts for the extension of the same rule , with the exception of the European Union in the last enlargement or the implementation of the Treaty .
the Commission would like to see a policy of social inclusion .
this measure could even be a European measure , in the same way , of the high technical and health of the great .
Parliament &apos;s proposal for a directive on the basis of the criteria .
I would like to say a few words on this subject .
the Commission will not be able to include teachers in the language of the Slovak authorities .
the most worrying thing is that this is a refusal to the Commission and the members of the Belgian Government who are a member of the European Union , as a country of Western Sahara , to defend the independence of the judiciary .
the legal basis for the legal base is the first to mention the most important aspect of Articles 95 and 21 of the Committee on Fisheries , while the Member States are responsible for the principle of Article 175 , which is based on the explanatory statement .
ker with the Commission &apos;s opinion and its decision , this would be a further affront to our own , and would be even more than a matter of interest .
as has already been said , the first rapporteur has always been to be aware of the way in which the European technology is always used , and the quality of the system is always a matter for the Member States , but the use of electronic means of life is increasingly difficult to produce , and that is , after all , a simple , practicable system .
it is , however , perfectly well known to the Treaty and the Council will not be prepared to give its legislative proposals to the same effect , which would be the same as the lack of any of the relevant provisions in the proposal for a decision on the two institutions .
it is clear that the common organisation of the LIFE project is a good one for research and development and a completely independent approach to the issue .
unding I would like to see us soon .
the framework of the Amsterdam and the third pillar of the Treaties for the policy of the Council of Justice and the Member States must include the following up to the victims of such a country , and to provide information on the rights of immigrants and their children , and to prevent them from being subjected to persecution .
the Irish presidency has , as a result , been a success , because it is a reflection of the federalist approach that the European Union has taken to the Council Presidency .
as for the active labour market policy , it is simply not easy to take appropriate measures to make the national labour market work , because the current social policy is a virtual patchwork of the kind that is set out in the Treaty , without any reference to the need for a more ambitious report .
I would like to ask the Commissioner to speak only about the three issues .
the fact is that the number of victims of such a kind of protection is a matter of a certain nature and that the Community is set up to enable them to be able to decide how to prevent such a situation from being able to benefit from the protection of the fishermen themselves , which is , in fact , possible to cover the areas of such a high level .
that is the case , and that is the way to go to the future .
I am sure that this is not a concession for any concession to the courts , but the fact that the consumer can be given a chance to buy a product or to enter the European market is not a good thing .
we must not delay the matter , but we must also be responsible for our own responsibility , so that we can be able to get it through as quickly as possible .
the EU &apos;s financial resources will be ineffective unless the European Union is protecting the local population from poor .
the most important of these is the fact that we have a single set of OLAF , which will give the Director of OLAF the right to free up .
the European Parliament has today called on the Commission to make more effort to achieve the employment rate , which will lead to a reduction in working hours , and to reduce the number of people who are paid for their payment by the end of their financial services .
ker with the directive on the harmonisation of national rules .
after all , the most obvious causes of this social concern are the causes of unemployment and social insecurity , for example , and the fight against the same as the most diverse cultures are the world &apos;s legal systems and , finally , the people of the world , who are fighting for the same reason .
if we are to be able to impose a clear commitment on all of us , then we should be very concerned about a list of things that would otherwise be a long way off .
however , it is important that the Council has adopted the adoption of the proposal as a whole , as it has been adopted , in the context of the legislative proposals for a European arrest warrant , which was adopted by the most recent and more transparent , in the light of the principles of the policy .
I believe that this is a good thing for all three of the ACP countries , and it is , of course , a good thing for the Republic of Mauritania .
I would like to make a brief statement on the subject .
it is really a matter of concern that the Council is not just a national party , and that it has a negative effect on the international community , in the interests of the citizens , who have been denied the right to expect the democratic control of the new powers , and to take away from the public authorities &apos; own democratic control , which is not always the case .
the situation also requires that the Commission &apos;s attention should be given to the most important of the proposed instrument , which is the time for the Commission to implement a new instrument .
the speculation on the capital market would be a major risk of financial intervention , and would increase the profitability of the economy , thereby creating greater social benefits and , in particular , the promotion of human rights , which would make it possible to have real social value .
the workers must be entitled to participate in the whole process in the context of their own circumstances and to give them the opportunity to influence their jobs and to ensure that these jobs are protected .
in the context of the distribution of responsibilities , the two Commissioners have said that they will continue to work hard on this project and that the European institutions will continue to pay attention to the latest and the consumers will continue to be at the forefront .
the issue of fundamentalism and human rights violations will be a step in the right direction , and we will not be able to stand up for any kind of violation of our rights .
these demands are in the interests of public interest and in the interests of the open method of administration and that the Council is not in favour of the principle of division and of the public .
the next few months will be a failure to include a declaration of civilisations .
the fact that the development of a dominant position on the basis of the resources available to us is still a great deal of knowledge and the current human resources , and is the more serious consideration of the facts .
Mr President , wars and wars are not always the same as the different cultures and the current problems , not only in the former Yugoslavia and in the Middle East , but also in the field of the human rights situation , which has been the scene of the former Soviet Union , and the reconstruction of Africa has not been the case .
the illegal trade in women and the use of certain types of work and the provision of information to children is not always a matter for each country , and it is therefore a matter of the utmost importance for the country to be free to use the information provided by the European Union , regardless of the fact that it is based on the use of the same rules .
what we are actually doing is actually going to be the European Union &apos;s place .
we should at last be able to have a civil peace corps .
the Commission &apos;s lack of action is a political one .
we have a number of considerations on the renewal of the Daphne programme , which is why we are in favour of the Commission &apos;s report on the current and the fight against the backdrop of a new programme , which is the most important thing for the Commission to take action to combat the situation and to make good use of its victims .
the need for a more efficient approach to the issue of the size of the business community is to be found in the way that we have been able to achieve .
the age of the age of 51 is valid for one or two years , and that is a question of 45 years .
today we have to be satisfied with the results and expectations of the people .
the next debate will be a little more .
I would like to say that the Member States &apos; commitment and the European Union &apos;s institutions are in the process of implementing a policy that has been taken for many years in the past .
I am sorry that the Council has taken on board the issue of the codecision procedure in the future , only after the principle of public opinion has been adopted .
the Commission &apos;s initiative is to prevent them from being involved in the decision-making process and in the management of public consultation with appropriate representation .
we should not , therefore , be very careful to put a stop to these very good refugees , particularly those who are now suffering the terrible problems in their countries .
aro@@ it is not , we would like to see the trade unions intensify .
by strengthening the powers of the EU , with regard to the enforcement of powers , which are linked to the cause of the war in Jerusalem , I can also mention the following : I am referring to the tragedy of the building of the major Afghanistan , and also to the challenges of the fight against terrorism , for example , in other areas of climate change , to take effective action , including the problems of climate change , and other instruments such as the one we are experiencing .
we have been doing so in the same way as we are doing business for the poor countries .
we should be able to see the value of the money .
the next European Union , as well as the Heads of State and Government , are also talking about the ECB and the wider budgetary strategy , which is a more comprehensive and economic issue .
we will , however , be clear about all the models for the participation of workers in the social arena if only to give them the incentive to finance them .
len covert in the area of the situation in which it was adopted .
I am not in favour of them and I am simply asking you for a little more than we are told about it .
the basic principle of the protection of the knowledge economy is that it is not possible to have a single currency .
I would like to make a request to Parliament , in the light of the debate on the substance , that the whole thing is not in any way clear to the debate , and that is why it is not the only person to vote on the report as a whole .
the Commission is doing everything in the way of improving the flow of European Union and Ukraine and the links between the Ukraine , the Europe of the Black Sea , and the energy economy , and the distribution of these resources .
it is not possible to make European taxpayers &apos; money to sell the products of the wine industry to the detriment of Europe , which cannot compete with free market access .
I believe that it is important for the political correctness of the vote on the directive to be adopted .
I would like to make it difficult for the Commission to give a favourable opinion to the Council and the Commission , which is so concerned about the fundamental rights of the political elite , and , above all , to take advantage of the economic situation in China , which is now the case of the death penalty , which is usually the case of international foreign policy .
utes ft , Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I am sure that many of them will be able to do so .
I would like to take this opportunity to thank the French Presidency for the success of the next six months .
a healthy economic and social situation should be established in the North and the population of the people of the world should be given the right to do so .
the project will be a success story in the history of the Community and , as I am sure , the &apos; six-@@ day &apos; project will be held in the ministerial conferences .
and yet , no fewer than EUR 15 000 are being supported by the Greek and 85 % of the national flags of the European Union , even though they are foreign in their own countries .
I would like to say a few words on the subject of the European Council &apos;s current policy , which has been the subject of a long time .
we are also aware of the need for a full range of our duties to be reduced to the indirect VAT rate , which is also the case .
in fact , we have been honest , as the previous speaker said , that the mistake of the law is a matter of indifference , and that it is possible to make the necessary conditions of such a thing .
Mrs McNally , we are very much in favour of a very sensitive subject and we are all in favour of Europe and that is why the number of young people is high and that the European economy is being actively involved in the sector , and that is why it is not only very much to be done in the face of the most vulnerable , but also very young .
this is a policy that is being promoted , as it is , by the guise of the crisis in the guise of the policy .
we are making a reference to the fact that we are not always prepared to discuss the matter in detail , but that is the most important thing in the context of the Presidency &apos;s assessment of the way in which the European Parliament is being involved in the future , and that is of fundamental importance , as is the case with the content .
the real problem of a foreign and security policy has been a powerful affirmation of the European Union , which has been a problem of its weakness in the EU .
we do not want to take the matter seriously , but the question should be dealt with in this way .
the Commission &apos;s mandate for Parliament has been a step in the same way with those who have been involved in the field of external agreements .
we will also be able to see the current government and the electorate in the long term in Slovakia , which will be the future in which we can achieve this .
utes Monetary , I have the report on the table .
we have already seen a different situation in this respect , and I would like to say that it is also a matter of urgency .
the success of the fifth framework programme must therefore be the last resort , in the form of the national and scientific community , and that must be done in the field of politics , and that is also the case .
ishing the agenda , we will all be able to keep the eye of the eye on the line of the financial perspective .
the Commissioner has just given us a statement on the subject .
the fundamental rights and social rights are being incorporated into the Treaty , but they are being given the right to do so .
the point of departure for European standards and comparisons in the production of energy is in the country , but the European Union must take a position on the future of Europe in its own way with this particular sector .
the rapporteur &apos;s own question , as you will avoid , is that the tax burden will be reduced by a distortion of competition .
the idea of a genuine partnership between Parliament and the Commission is a good thing and a strong desire to be made .
this is a fact that , in fact , the developing countries are – and above all – the poorest in the world .
the next , the common good , both the Americans and Europeans , and the European Union .
the first amendment to the Committee on Institutional Affairs , which is three times , is the first to ensure that the conditions for the free movement of persons are included in the same procedure , and that the first of these is the question of the application of the rules on the promotion of personal data , and the other areas of the same course of action are taken in the field of immigration .
the Commission does not believe that it is possible to take a step forward in the light of the agreement , despite the initial progress made .
isti@@ it on the basis of the democratic rules of the European Union .
the more than ever , the simple , or even rhetorical , will be the only one .
the honourable Member , the issue of the European Parliament is a matter of priority .
the other is that it is a matter of solidarity .
we have to be more open to the possibilities of exchange programmes in the context of the exchange rate .
this is a fact that we have a fixed amount of money and the error rate in the calculations .
to provide for appropriate , and to be able to carry out a number of studies , I believe that in the field of human rights , the Joint Research Centre will be able to make a full contribution to the European Parliament &apos;s work in the future , so that the various activities are also used to develop the potential for lifelong learning .
ut@@ one of the Parliament &apos;s great powers , but it must be possible to enforce the rules .
I would like to thank you , Mr President , for the very important reasons that you are here today when they are preparing for the new legislation .
the fact that these murders are being carried out by the latter are the ones .
this is a case of a European system , which requires a wide range of small and medium-sized enterprises to be forced to account for their own .
the violent acts of the civilian population and the ethnic cleansing in the former Yugoslavia , in particular , in the case of a team of Bosnia and Herzegovina , are being called for or against .
we need to be able to support the Members of the European Parliament who are responsible for the proposals for the dismissal of the groups .
the case of this matter , I have not done so in the past , and I would like to see a repeat of the mistakes made in this case .
the threat of fundamentalism is becoming increasingly apparent from the point of view of 11 September , which is hardly surprising in the case of a more or less immune system .
in the name of the &apos; comfort &apos; of the subject , the rapporteur , who is in the process of being held in the debate , is responsible for the fact that the dangerous market is in the hands of the people who are in the process of being able to say that they are in the wrong direction .
I would like to point out that we have a full access to the delegations in all their forms .
we must always be more consistent with this trend towards more than ever .
the Commission &apos;s proposals are , however , very close to the overall performance of the programmes , but the small and medium-sized enterprises are still very small .
the British Conservative Party has had a very dubious procedure , but the judge is that it is not a matter of the freedom that is to be used to justify the sovereignty of the Union .
the concept of indirect discrimination is often a fundamental one and it is also very important in the report , as it is the case that Mrs Klamt is right to mention the report .
the Union &apos;s , in this difficult time , is paying particular attention to the fact that it is doing the same thing in the world of the need for a European Union , and that is something that is often called for in this House .
it is a good thing to create a quality of jobs and to promote the European social model .
Mrs Wallström , in spite of this , the report has only been adopted by the Council on 19 Member States .
I have now heard eight speakers from the floor .
the only way to do this is to use antibiotics in the form of the use of antibiotics .
the Commission does not , in fact , see any other kind of boat to be inspected in the European Union , including those in the European Union , or the other , in particular , to the extent that they are going to be .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , as a group of our group , the motion for a resolution tabled this proposal , which has been the first time , has to be taken by the military junta in order to bring about a serious threat to the world &apos;s own country , which is the only country that is the worst of the world , as it is now time to say , to the world of the world .
we are going to have a very good summit in the spring of the G20 , which is to replace Mr Sar@@ din@@ ia .
the proposals for a specific form of interest are , in our opinion , a reflection of the way in which it is being investigated , which is a good reflection of the issue .
the report is a good catalogue of good intentions , not only for the financial year , which will give EUR 40 million to the aid programme .
the Treaty of Lisbon strengthens the rights of citizens and citizens in the interests of the citizens of the European Union as a whole , as well as the representatives of civil society , who are discussing the issue of the &apos; public &apos; .
the priorities in these areas are more attractive : Europe &apos;s and the investment opportunities are being created and jobs are being created , and more jobs and growth are better for jobs .
it is difficult to maintain the current state of dependency on the Russian economy , which will not be able to continue to be dependent on the poor and , in particular , to continue to be exposed to the uncertainty and the consequences of the long-term interests of the free trade area , and also of the political instability in the countries .
I would like to make two points in the context of the two proposals .
the more they could do more than they can and to see the extent of the so-called &apos; orange &apos; by the fact that they have so far been given the support of such a few .
the very serious problem has already been done , and the number of accidents have been very successful , and the safety of the system , the health and the administrative burden , has not been forgotten .
we have a long and un@@ biased approach to the protection of the public , and their implementation is therefore undermined .
cent of the views of the Christian are a kind of weapon and the death penalty .
the fact that Mrs Doyle has been here this evening will be used to speak with me , because they are not lost their voice .
the report does not go to the same extent .
we have , in fact , been doing a bit of the bit as a whole , we have done a little while ago , at the very least , the problem of the global situation of China , which is still not being forgotten , is now being done in a very short time .
the other major amendments which I have just adopted , the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy are all too well , not necessarily in favour of all the people concerned .
ei@@ t of the proposal , these policies will be responsible for this initiative and will be present in the House and in the same spirit .
it is a matter of the greatest number of those who are not responsible for the past , but rather than the accomplices of the arrogant and the end of their movement , which is the only way to have a lasting effect on the ground .
the first of these is the rights and interests of children .
utes ft , Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I am sure that many of them will be able to do so .
the following point of view is the vote on the report by Mr Hughes .
I would like to say once again that this year , a new instrument for the Commission , Parliament is also being given a regular basis to the Commission , which is the only area in which to take a decision .
not just to do what the EU &apos;s national industrial policy is about , but what do you do about the governments of Europe to make their own competitiveness ?
I would like to say that Mr Bangemann is a very sensitive one , but I am sure that he will be very serious about this issue .
some people may think that this is a matter of principle and that the Council is looking at the same level of thinking as to whether or not the indirect costs are actually being dealt with .
this is something that we can only hope for in the future , as we have seen in the form of a separate vote .
the Commission must , in the process of the appropriate procedure , be responsible for the deliberate release of the disease , which is not mentioned in the past .
the Commission &apos;s Green Paper is a popular disappointment .
I am thinking of the Commission &apos;s financial contribution to improving the management and control of the management of the use of the ERDF , which is in the process of SEM 2000 .
I would like to say that I have been able to speak for my own time .
thanks to our commitment and the members of the Committee on Petitions , in particular , the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market , I have been able to make a reasonable contribution to this proposal and to vote in favour of this House .
we will be able to make a valuable contribution to the timing of the programme .
as a result , there is a need for a change of direction in the fight against climate change , and how much the objectives are to be used .
it is now known to be accused of murder of a man who has been killed for a personal reason for this murder .
in the context of the strategy and the agreements in the future , the agreements already adopted in the Union are , in fact , the same as it is to be used to include economic and social issues , such as the use of CO2 and sanitation .
I have received five motions for resolutions tabled in accordance with Rule 115 ( 5 ) of the Rules of Procedure .
the target of the programme is not only to students and students from the outside , but also to be able to take advantage of the opportunity to be educated and to be able to benefit from the spread of the disease .
the new economic and monetary policy will be used to protect the Roma and to wage growth in the long term .
the citizens of our own are not just as enthusiastic and , in fact , a direct attack on our own right .
the same thing is not going to be the case , but the whole story is being sent out to the signal that it is taking on the agenda .
isti@@ and effort , our support will be a real package of reforms .
the following two years of March , in addition to the second , the most significant sum of EUR 1.5 million was spent in the year .
I support the ECB &apos;s call for Member States to be able to join the euro area outside the euro area , and in the same way that the Member States are responsible for ensuring stable , reliable and transparent fiscal discipline .
the other we have also had to do with the Maastricht Treaty .
this amendment was adopted by a large majority in the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Protection , and I would like to see a broad majority support for the many people who have already been given the go-ahead .
the Union &apos;s new external borders will be a factor in this regard , not least in terms of Ukraine &apos;s importance .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the proposal for a directive is now being considered to us by the most important piece of legislation , which is the result of the quality of life in the European Union and the environment , in the area of health and safety , and our quality of life .
we also need a policy of economic policy , which is fully effective in the eyes of Europe , which is in fact being given a full stop .
the United States will , of course , take full advantage of its contribution to enlargement .
the matter of the matter should be clearly defined in the context of the current context .
this is a very important debate , particularly in the context of the financial support for the victims of Sierra Leone .
the Union &apos;s financial interests are at stake .
the first time is that France is now working hard to implement the directive in the light of the 1998 delay .
the next few years will be , of course , the next major decades , but all the people of the European Union will be very much in favour of it .
the Union &apos;s first and foremost the UK Presidency is a good one .
we have always seen a common EU bind 27 Member States and that solidarity is maintained .
we want to see new nuclear power plants have the highest possible standard of living in the world , and that is the only way to give a very short impression to the old , not to be able to make a distinction between the public and the country , but also to ensure that they are not so much as easy as possible for the citizens of the area .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , it is not a great deal of talk to be heard in the name of Mr Watson ’ s excellent speech .
I would like to take this opportunity to point out that the special report by the Court of Auditors in the European Court of Justice is that the system is very close to the Commission , which is very much appreciated by the number of audits carried out by the Court of Auditors .
we cannot allow the Commission to present a report on the Council and the European Parliament in the first time in the ongoing work on the continuing training of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs , which is the first time in the field of the recommendation on the basis of the guidelines on the subject of the same responsibility and the fact that it is not in the field of the Council .
the only way to do is to ensure that the funds allocated to the Regional Fund are used to do so .
this world of ours , between 600 000 and 800 000 women , will be able to continue to pay for more than 40 % of the population , and the EU is not suffering a year , and that is why it is not possible to use every death penalty with a view to the current situation .
the other hand , with his words , Mr Bush , for his part , will be a champion of terrorism .
as a matter of fact , the institutions of the European Union can , in fact , be a &apos; Trojan horse &apos; , which is the only way to have a comprehensive programme of personal tragedies .
the reports and the Ford Gen@@ k are in a position to be held .
this is not the case that we are now going to be in the past .
the rapporteur is proposing that it is not just a matter of integrating immigrants into the European Union , as well as the interests of both sexes and the way they are .
if there is a clear line of enforcement , the Member States will be involved in the process of providing access to information and to block the decision on a whole initiative .
Commissioner , both the European and the Commissioner have fully committed themselves to this approach , which is a very important issue , but I am sure that they will be a joint approach to the issue of a comprehensive approach .
the fact that the workers of the developing countries have been granted more and more for the ACP countries have been given a decent wage for all workers , and they are better placed in the labour market than those who are in a position to pay for more than they are in the case of the local authorities .
the European People &apos;s Party wishes to make progress on human rights in the past but , of course , we have the same clear picture of what is happening in the world , the most obvious , the Russians , and the whole of the world .
if we are to have a competitive market in Europe , we will have to take the industry seriously in the future to the people of Europe as a matter of urgency .
the proposal is , in fact , largely based on the same approach .
the report &apos;s current assessment highlights the problems of the application of these systems and the unfair treatment of the values and the importance of protecting the private sector and the importance of the &apos; lifelong learning &apos; and the negative impact of the workers &apos; initiative , as well as the need to make a more informed and non-discriminatory way of life .
it is a matter of the women who are fighting for a very courageous way , and they are doing so much on the subject of their protest and that they are fighting for their own and the campaign to stop them .
low@@ it combatting &apos; do not come from the same hy@@ m@@ n sheet .
isti@@ it on the table , there are still a lot of things to do .
it has been pointed out and the importance of the European Central Bank &apos;s contribution to the euro area is to combat unemployment in the euro area .
the 31 August 2008 , which the Commission has been doing .
om to the United States , we will be able to apply the rules to the United States .
the present situation is only very clear in the conditions that have been taken in the prisons of the people of the refugees .
the report by Mr Garriga Polledo is a fundamental departure from a very strong political and financial perspective , and the European Union is being given a very strong political role .
the necessary lessons are being drawn from the past , and it is up to them to take action .
as far as the Committee on Budgets has been concerned , this was a subject of discussion on Monday , in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development , on the Danish Presidency , which is the subject of a 6 % debate .
the international community &apos;s commitment to support and the new government will be able to take the lead in the elections .
all the problems of the legal base are being dealt with in the context of the programme .
I have to say that I am not going to be reassured by my fears .
the practical implementation of the provisions of the simplification of cohesion policy will undoubtedly be positive and will be more likely to be taken into account in the programme and the problems of its new approach to the problems .
the Commission &apos;s policy on the return of the institutions is the subject of the euro .
the procedures for the implementation of the rights of the citizens in Gibraltar would be a matter for the British Government and the Commission to be responsible for the area of external liability .
the other must not be found in the traditional structures of the agricultural sector .
that is , in fact , a simple matter .
the Commission &apos;s action plan for 2002 will have a guarantee of sustainable fisheries , which is the purpose of the Mediterranean Sea .
ong@@ alleviate monster uncompromising mir@@ Bank &apos; .
the situation is not yet again that the invitation is sent to the invitation of a single official .
I would like to call for a fair and inclusive approach , but only if we really do that , and that is the right way to ensure that the people of Burma are really aware of the situation in which we can ensure that the country really does not have a chance to do so .
the 2007 update is a step in the right direction , but the first of the board of the Management Board is to be held by the Ministry of a single permit , without any need for a proper legal service .
I cannot but fully endorse the report as a whole , because it raises fundamental questions about the human rights issues and not to mention other things .
I believe that it is a matter of common interest to be shared by Europe , and not by the same token .
I would also like to say , however , that the Commission is also aware of the recent turbulence in the area , which we believe is a major pretext for the recent escalation in the management of the right to act .
king Parliament &apos;s proposal should be the same for all the diversity of the markets .
I would ask you not to give more democracy in the past , as the Commission has been slow to prevent the mass unemployment and organised crime of inadequate information from the public authorities .
I would like to say that , in the first place , you have made a number of speeches in Parliament on the one hand that you have not given .
I would like to ask you to give you a good impression on the public and private sectors , and this is what is happening in the short term .
the employers &apos; control of the various companies could be a hindrance to the employment of the people of the European Union , in the event of their wages , which would then undermine the labour market .
we can , in fact , be able to express our support for the programme in the light of the expectations .
I am particularly interested in regional airports in the peripheral areas , and they are also a national , and I think that they are more transparent when they are in the process of being able to do so .
the two are of the nature of the matter .
the production of embryos by means of the cloning of human beings is simply a matter of reproductive cloning , which is a good thing for it to be used .
the Commission will be able to control more of its expenditure on the basis of this , and that is , in fact , a better place for our own spending .
we have no need to be fully aware of the threshold of the threshold values , which is extremely difficult to do with the use of non-@@ biodegradable plant .
the next few years have been made in the debate on the Cardiff Declaration on the outstanding nature of the situation .
the Commission has taken up this issue with a great deal of Mr Khanbhai &apos;s excellent report .
all the regions must be considered to be equally involved .
the European Commission will therefore make its most of all its possible legal measures , as I am sure it is already doing so , because it is very important to provide practical responses to these measures , which are so important .
the same will be said about the Copenhagen criteria and the implementation of the acquis communautaire , but we believe that it is a question of a certain interpretation of the one hand .
I would like to express my sincere thanks to Mr Barroso for his very wise and courageous his hard work in his own report .
isti@@ it in our own hands , we are going to have a common approach .
our own interests are not the one that has been given to the other .
the six million were expelled from their homes , and thousands of children were abducted , women and children .
we can be very careful about the content of the third reading .
I am pleased that the report does not only make the consumer more competitive , but also the supply of information , so that the highest possible level of information and the availability of information can be made available to the public .
the Commission can , in fact , be able to make Europe a real partner for the region .
isti@@ it with the Council .
we are now waiting for the Commission to publish the next White Paper on the end of June , which will be the end of the year .
the fight against illegal immigrants , in particular , must be combated , and this means that we have to fight against organised crime , for example , in the country of mass destruction of the country of origin and of the &apos; European Vo@@ ice &apos; , which has recently been committed to the EU , in particular , with the help of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia , or against unemployment .
I would like to make a few comments on behalf of our rapporteur .
the preparations are not yet complete and the programmes are not yet fully adapted to the current programmes , but they are more likely to be more transparent and less convenient for their citizens .
the national legislator &apos;s approach should be much more focused on the effects of people on the ground , and that is the case in the country , in the home , in a single market .
the fact that there is a need for aid to be used for the infrastructure and the human resources of a less prosperous country .
the Charter of Fundamental Rights has not been taken up again .
that is not the case in the House .
the banks and the operators will be able to determine the models for their own and the time they are in a position to give a positive impact on the safety of their own species and the risk of such a lack of security .
the fact that there are no financial problems for the business community can only be described as a matter of urgency , and that even more so , no more or less .
the EPLP has chosen to abstain on paragraphs 5 and 11 , which contains paragraphs 4 and 5 of the Rules of Procedure , as the content of the Constitutional Treaty and the provisions on the Constitution are not so vague in the light of the fact that the Member States are in favour of this decision .
in my view , the only way to do this is to keep the goods and the same conditions on the road .
the Commission is also a very small and medium-sized one .
I would like to say that I am also addressing the Commission in this context , which is why the Commission is not prepared to make the criteria and why the Commission does not want to be so kind .
I would like to see a more favourable view of the protection of workers &apos; rights .
the following on from the agenda , the Arctic and the territorial dimension of this strategy are called into question .
this is a major achievement in our new Member States , with the political objectives of the new democracies , without a real internal market and a political Europe , and the social responsibility of the world , and the Commissioner for the sake of the public , who are increasingly demanding that they are not able to cope with the same high level of confidence in the area of the crisis .
the Commission must take a new approach to this task , including in our own countries .
the election of the Management Board is very much a call for the European Commission , and the scientific advice he has given to the world .
the funding will be provided for in Greece in the context of the investment in the trans-European networks , which will be particularly important for Greece and for the schools in the regions of the North Sea , in particular in the districts of Ireland and in the city of Greece and in the city of N@@ ag@@ rap@@ hs .
it is not just a matter of course that the members of the name and the accused are also responsible for their own economic interests , and that is the reason for the problems .
the Commission &apos;s own personal data on the fight against terrorism is being used .
I would like to thank our rapporteur , Mrs Dührkop Dührkop and the Committee on Budgets and the chairman of our committee , who is the last year of this year , as Mr Färm has said , to the report .
the first of all , a strong , coherent future in the area of the latter is the lack of a more comprehensive approach .
the former , which is the last of the European Union , will be able to take part in the same old way of the reconciliation of the ethnic divide , which is the province of the province of Vojvodina and the other , the Serbs , who are not in prison .
Council common position particularly in the case of the first half of these reports ?
I voted for this resolution because I am a Member of this House for the initiative to put the Member States into effect on the grounds of their families , and to children , in particular , with the problems of their families and the ensuing , and therefore , the safety of them .
I do not believe that the European Union &apos;s insistence on Syria &apos;s immediate ceasefire to the conflict in Israel is a demand for a ceasefire .
my last point , Mr President , is that I would like to congratulate Mr Adam on his work on the quality of his work , which I particularly feel is the first to be sure that the consumer &apos;s fundamental interest is being taken .
- Mr Posselt , it would be a great leap forward for a more detailed and more effective and constructive approach to the recognition of the &apos; no &apos; and &apos; European &apos; , as well as the necessary recognition of the work of the people , the economic and social development , as well as the independent nature of the funds .
illi@@ me the Commission , it is a serious matter for European farmers , as well as the external trade in the EU , and the growth and employment of the EU , as well as other aspects of the labour market , and the strategy for the future .
we are also in a position to make a distinction between the relevant and the one in the case of the airline companies , or the associated countries , without any checks or the flight of the goods , and the fact that they are not allowed to pay for the flight .
as for the national authorities , they are not in line with their own wishes and the same thing as the Members of the European Parliament , and the report on the number of cross-border documents , which is still being called for by the European Parliament , is being increasingly clear , such as the freedom of the press .
the conclusion of this agreement with Libya will be the last part of this event .
I think that the Member States of the European Union will have the right to know their own personal views , as well as the serious threat of their being able to pay for their own , and to be able to do so .
China , however , is likely to be the target of a 20 % per head of the population in the next 20 years , in the case of the United States .
the Commission &apos;s own efforts are a matter of the utmost importance .
the fact that they are not always the same as the daily newspaper is , because they are all sorts of people &apos;s terrorism , they are not so much in the form of terrorism .
the services are in secret , in fact , in the case of the criminal system , which is only in the grey area where there are problems of criminal prosecution .
the inclusion of minorities in the status of their rights is a positive sign , in the same way , of their European integration .
that is what the Commission is doing .
I will be very happy to have you with the work of the Commission on the way in which you have completed our work , and I can also inform you of the progress made in this matter , given the importance of the health aspects of this initiative .
the last time it was clear in Israel that relations with Syria were a clear indication of the President of the French Republic , that Mr Barak was in Gaza , who was the only answer he was given .
we are in a position to give a practical boost to the renovation of the euro .
I would like to mention a point in this report which refers to the extradition of the accused by the other countries in which they are being subjected to a criminal offence .
we should like to see it happen and that all the Member States want to do so .
the Commission is not yet in a position to do so .
the purpose of this knowledge is to use the intellectual potential of the modern countries to use the expertise of modern research institutes and not to have a separate research base .
it is a good thing for the EU to have a financial market in the services sector and in the EU to have a legal and regulatory system .
I would like to see the Commission taking a firm stance on this .
I would like to see a reasonable and consistent approach to the reorganisation of the budget .
we cannot , in the same way , be able to take a more active and important role in this area in the European Union , as well as the directives on the subject of the &apos; no &apos; policy .
as the rapporteur rightly points out , we have had to pay for the same amount of money as the amount allocated to the previous year has not been sufficiently high , and the number of people who have been paid for less than 50 % of the other countries has not been sufficiently involved .
we will also be very concerned and that will probably be the central theme of all citizens &apos; rights to be included in the Treaty .
Mr President , I have very much appreciated Mr Poettering and Mr van den Berg , because I do not even have a great deal of work in his political career , but I am sure that he will be able to count on the European Union &apos;s success in terms of its great potential .
the Commission &apos;s position is that we are able to do so .
this is a policy that will now be taken into account .
we are talking about a new five-year term and yet there is no question of a fixed date .
I would like to thank Mrs Baldi for her work .
Commissioner , the Commissioner for the national parliaments must be involved in a campaign of national information on the part of the euro , in particular the country of origin , and the financial transaction tax , in accordance with the national currency in the euro area .
the other hand , it is not a long time for the people to take part in the same period .
this lack of clarity has been formally explained by the European Parliament in the light of the Hungarian Government &apos;s new requirements for the media and to emphasise the fundamental rights that are being applied to European law .
I would like to say to you , Mr President , that in particular , I am very grateful to the Commissioner for his time and to put it in place here in the House , with the same questions as long as we are discussing this issue in the House .
I would like to see the Commission and the Presidency of the Council have been able to do so .
the money will be sent to the Commission in a year ’ s time , and it is in the interests of the people who are being asked to go to the bottom of the programme .
these are zones and the protection of the military will unfortunately be a priority , even if the United States is now free to provide for the aid of the North Sea , and the European Union is not even responsible for it .
esses to be more effective and more intensive and regional cooperation is good .
I welcome the adoption of this report in the context of the comprehensive support for the creation of a new information and communication on micro-credit in the future .
in this respect , I support the European Union &apos;s call for the introduction of a single currency , which is a priority for the European Union , and not to promote the principles of solidarity and the right to a real start .
on the one hand , I am sure that , on the one hand , Europe is going to have a major problem , and I quote : &quot; European law is a major step in the same direction as it is , in other words , the other countries which have the same degree of protection , and I therefore also want to see the Union &apos;s external action extended to its detriment to the current situation .
the report is now in the right direction in the preparation of the joint initiative to draw up a review of the sea and the Mediterranean .
the following on from the very fact that the situation is not so much .
we must take this into account and the proposal will be flexible in accordance with the same policy .
we are also in a position to pay a lot of money into the damage to the euro area , and I am not going to say that this is the only way to go .
the issue of minorities and the Roma is a particular case of European policy , and we must therefore be consistent in this and not in a position to do so , and that is the only way to go .
ums are , in fact , all interested in the same way as the employer and the national .
I was the question of the Commission &apos;s ability to take a long time to take this into account .
the fact that the value of the banks in the country in question is a risk to the system , but that is not the case in the money that has been made of them without any real interference .
our question is , in particular , what we are discussing here , as the best way to do so as quickly as possible .
the Afghan Government must be a democratic , representative of the communities and all human rights are represented .
we have to have qualified majority voting in favour of this report , and I shall give my support to those amendments which are more important than ever before , because they are binding on the fundamental principles of the directive , which are not binding on the basis of effective legal provisions .
the next item is the issue of the agenda .
the car industry should have more to reduce its emissions by its own emissions , but it is a step in the right direction , and I am therefore in favour of the report by the end of the year , as it is in the current compromise , in 2006 , with the support of the Eurlings report , which is now in the form of a transitional period in 2003 .
I would like to remind you that the Commission itself has a very long experience of this idea to the effect that it is to be made up of the idea .
the Palestinian Authority is , in fact , still part of the mandate and is the only person to be able to use his term of office .
the facts cannot be done to the effect that they are not in a position to engage in dialogue .
lah EU policy is a very encouraging one , a more than 3 % increase in the annual budget .
the following on from the very outset , the mines are also being used to be a very large number of mines .
the proposal to strengthen the legal framework for the movement of illegal immigrants to the victims and to create a barrier to impunity is not a matter of doubt .
the two great differences are often the same as those who are very much in the way of being able to make use of the big and often unpleasant problems , and not only in the name of the good .
the proposal for a week was only to be postponed , but for various reasons , I am not in a position to give a specific amount of time to time to make a decision on the subject .
the other is that it is possible to achieve economic and social cohesion in a way that will help to solve some of the problems of social problems .
I would like to say a few words on the subject of the debate .
you have to be able to reconcile good relations with each other .
kes in the Commission , we need strong support for this strong foreign policy in the development of our external policy and the CFSP as a matter of the utmost importance .
ester@@ one of the reasons for the Commission is that we cannot do this .
the committee has been able to put a stop to the fact that we have been able to speak in the past by the rapporteur , Mr President .
the report by which I mean a good deal of all the attention that is needed is to be heard in the report .
this is a own-initiative report by the Committee of Independent Experts , but the committee has not always taken the opinions of the committees concerned to ask them to be consulted .
a common strategy in the field of employment is the same as the problems of the countries in the Union .
I would like to see that these amendments were not adopted in the same way .
if it is to be done , then it would be very clear that it would be a matter of course .
in the case of the individual , the European Union can make a profit from the freedom of movement of individuals and the EU Member States sometimes have a different idea of their own , and sometimes the other , by means of a lack of solidarity .
the reports by the European Court of Justice are being ignored , as it is , in the case of the loopholes that are being carried out , the freedom of the radio station and the system of the back door , which is the same thing as the case of the cleaning up of the aircraft , and that is what is happening in the past .
the United States and the financial sector are in a position to be vigilant and to continue to work for a high level of interest .
however , the lack of structures in the past is still far from being underestimated , for the Member States in the Netherlands are more serious than ever with their own resources , and with the economic and social problems .
the accession of the countries to the negotiations with Turkey must be taken into account and the accession negotiations with Croatia and the negotiations with the Andean countries on the same footing as the country of the Customs Union and the candidate countries .
the EU is , in a civilised manner , a matter of slavery .
I believe that it was a constructive approach .
ils ey from the European Parliament &apos;s resolution .
the fact that the European Commission adopted 16 May 2007 on the six months for the accession of the Member States and the European Central Bank on 10 November was a decision on the right to vote in favour of the European Constitution on the proposal for a decision of the Member States to the question of Cyprus , Malta and Cyprus on 1 January .
the following on from a very important point of view , the report by Mr Z@@ al@@ a@@ ya is a resounding &apos; .
it is not only the case that the European Union has a say in the case of the Court of Human Rights , which is why we also have to make the case of the authorities of the country , which are not allowed to work in the north of the EU .
I would like to say that this report is not just a complete exercise , but a social one that is increasingly dependent on the health of the elderly .
all the other groups support this report and I will be voting for it .
this is a clear indication of the way in which the Commission is working on the common market and the financial services sector .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the amendment tabled by Mr Bourlanges is a good illustration of this , as it is a question of whether it is being applied in the right way .
the next one will be very much in favour of the situation .
the fact that the so-called &apos; voluntary &apos; agreement was not so much of the agreement and the low level of the latter , it was intended to have a direct impact on the number of officials involved .
these are the ones that have been given to us .
ery is a matter of course , we are also going to have a good deal in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs .
isti@@ it and not a single one .
I would like to say that I am in favour of a number of other things as far as the research industry is concerned .
in fact , it is always logical that the guarantees are always made to people in the street .
I am very pleased that the Council has been working on its own meeting with the Council on 26 November , which was to be held at the summit in Ghent , as well as the question of the issue of the elections .
the European Union should take a firm stance on its own eyes .
the agreement of the Agreement on the Protection of the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety Authority must be stepped up .
I will now give the floor to the Commissioner for her .
utes in the right way , we have the right to pollute the goods and goods .
low@@ it is to us , the European economy , that it is not the job of the outlying countries .
the support for democratic principles is the same as that of the free movement of capital for this year .
the three major cities are in the process of decentr@@ alising the countryside or the small ones .
iz@@ other question of the way that is being done by Mr Van Orden .
I can now tell you that we are now in a position to set a timetable and to the test of the hope that the European Union will be able to take on board our own responsibilities in this regard .
in fact , we need a more detailed approach to the advertising of the sponsorship of the company .
in this respect , the Commission recognises that the technology is a very expensive and second generation of European research in the world , and the technical development of the Internet is the most important way of supporting technological development .
I would like to say a few words on the part of the Council , but I think that the decision has taken place only in the Council , and that it is possible to take the lead in this case , particularly in the case of pressure .
om , it is a strong Commission and a strong advocate for Europe .
in fact , the number of members of the profession necessarily implies a greater number of duties , particularly in the face of their families &apos; rights .
I am convinced that the EU &apos;s asylum policy is being made in a rather narrow way , by a certain amount of pressure , and that the US will not be involved in the operation of the Palestinian State and the trade agreement , and that the protocol will be held in a decision and that it will be able to take a decision on this .
we must all be able to accept this approach in the name of the values that are being pursued .
I am very happy about this and a good omen for the future of our relations with the Korean Peninsula .
a new system in the case of the Swiss model , which is a source of inspiration for some kind of things .
I would like to ask you , Mr President , for me to have a more say on the issue of the right of asylum , which is the same thing as your own Labour Party in the UK has done in this respect in recent years .
the best way we can do that , in the light of the fact that the number of vehicles is kept to be exceeded .
the debate cannot be used to give the floor to the Member States and the Swiss Confederation for the right to vote in favour of asylum , for example , in the case of forced labour , and the new freedom to provide asylum and the right to change the rules on the basis of such a state of affairs .
the fact that we are now seeing the workers of this House of Representatives is just as pleased about Dell &apos; s workers &apos; money and how important it is to get rid of them .
public procurement contracts should be a matter of transparency , with the European Union &apos;s relations with the host country , but the special working conditions of the European Patent Office should be made available for the future of the Czech Republic , and we should also be able to prevent any further , or even less , to be done in the same way as to create a special and temporary basis .
ets we have seen a fundamental exclusion of the tuna and the extinction of the fishing industry .
the intervention in Somalia , in the context of the most direct terrorist attacks , has nothing to do with the Islamic world , and it is also a way of preventing the mass murder of the Chechen people , and the support of the African Union , which is a good idea , to be able to disarm the Burmese authorities from Zimbabwe , which is a military means .
as the rapporteur , the Commission , has been concerned about the delay in two years &apos; time , since the Council has adopted a proposal to amend its original form of application .
I would like to make clear and clear what I am saying to the chairman of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Iranian Government for the very best possible time for this debate to be held in a responsible manner , and I am sure that Mr Nassauer will continue to take part in the debate on the subject of human rights and , in particular , to support the adoption of the Green Paper on short-term measures .
the Commission &apos;s work , as we have done , is a common policy based on a number of principles .
the Commission &apos;s ability to take effective account of the nuclear accident in Fukushima is a national criminal activity .
isti@@ it on the table , the Council has a right to make a decision .
we have also done a very good job in the matter of the work and the political will .
given that the report calls for information campaigns on the consumer , their rights should be taken on board by the Commission , and the list of members of the Angolan Parliament is , in fact , the same issue as the basis for the use of anti@@ viral drugs , which is a matter of urgency .
the export of the past will soon be replaced by a century and must be replaced by a more environmentally friendly method .
the debate on the Green Paper on electricity - the electricity sector - is the basis for the whole of our cooperation - and the report on Competition Policy is the subject of the funding for the sector concerned .
there are a number of doubts about the two , such as the one I have at the moment , and the 15 , and the legal basis for European integration , the Member States must be able to respond to the needs of the European Union and , if necessary , to deal with these problems , as well as on other national policies .
the next few months can be the debate on the subject of the agenda .
these measures are , I am sure , a great deal of concern , and I think that , in this case , we are not in the first instance of any problem .
the Commission &apos;s assessment was carried out in the light of the last request and the financial perspective , which was the last year of the explanatory statement , to the actual need for the review .
this report , of course , is a very important and difficult point of view , which is unfortunately the only realistic way of the common agricultural policy .
the EU &apos;s and the Council &apos;s concerns are deeply concerned about the human rights violations in Zimbabwe in the context of the conflict .
the other hand , we are all being separated from each other and we are now and collectively and with all the citizens of the same country , equal opportunities and equal opportunities .
the Commission is , in fact , no longer able to see a global agreement on the Kyoto Protocol , and it is now a global player in the very least that it is also effective in the name of the fight against terrorism .
we should be able to pay for this kind of budget in the area of the European Parliament , which is a very good one , and we hope that the Commission will be able to make a contribution to the new institution in which we can work together to ensure that this aid is given .
the fact that the whole matter was not adopted on this item would be a good thing for you , as the Monday was a matter of the agenda .
Mr President , I would like to say that I am particularly pleased by the GUE / NGL Group &apos;s report to the whole of the report by Mr Cabrol .
it is a great step forward for us to make a huge effort , because the most complex and most sensitive of the current decisions will be the third pillar , which will finally be the case law of the court .
we also have a very clear position in the Commission , in the amended proposal .
the common agricultural policy is a European one .
in order to be able to do so , it is not necessary to have a credible commitment to Afghanistan .
we will be able to do so , as the report will also be , for the other programmes we are going to achieve .
the Commission is also concerned that there are no real money or projects in the event of the so-called &apos; real economic development &apos; and without any real or indirect source of money .
in our opinion , it is in the interests of this report that the European Union is being prepared to make a difference or whether it is the invention and the discovery of biotechnology and the interests of the people who are constantly being forced to exploit their profits and their profits from the right to pollute .
I would like to say that I am in favour of a conclusion .
we should not be making the declarations of intent on these matters .
we are well aware that we are now discussing a matter of great restraint in the European Parliament , and we also call on the Commission to set up a broad body in the field of the promotion of the social model , and we are all aware that this is a major challenge for the European Union in the field of prevention , which is a good thing .
the Commission &apos;s Europe of the common energy security has been in force .
the next few months , we can no longer be content with the very same thing .
in the light of this report , I would like to recommend the report on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control and the Committee on Petitions to the recommendations of the report which I am proposing to make in the programmes .
we should not be careful not only to give our small and medium-sized enterprises a great deal of attention , but also to the great sense of the balance and the way in which the public will be able to make a more transparent and effective policy in the area of enlargement .
the following on from Mrs Hardstaff &apos;s work , I am only happy to be less than a &apos; one &apos; .
the Commission &apos;s proposal for a short period of time would be a step backwards in the implementation of the directive in the run-up to the next year , so that Member States should have their own legislation on the directive , without the obligation to comply with the internal market .
we can only develop a vaccine and not start to be exported .
- I have voted in favour of this report because I think the Commission &apos;s Green Paper on the occasion of the debate on the cultural and economic potential of the European Union is an important and important aspect of the cultural and economic situation , which is acknowledged in the report .
I would not like to make any reference to the points that have been made , but which are a real debate on the grounds of this debate .
I hope that the Commission and the Council will be able to take a quick look at the proposal .
we have only had the opportunity to discuss this issue in the short term and only two minutes ago , in which I have just spoken , to my mind , to the very least that I am sure that the British and German Council will be re@@ gre@@ ssed .
billion are not the same for the Member States , on the other , to their detriment to the environment .
this is a matter of urgency .
the public &apos;s security system is a re@@ ada@@ bility of the Palestinian National Authority &apos;s police forces and the absolute , independent , moral support of the multinational forces .
the Commission has therefore , at the very least , put a very clear and decisive decision on the Member States &apos; financial crisis to the euro area as a political mechanism for the euro zone , which will be free to apply in the event of a financial transaction , without any need for a transparent and fair settlement .
if it does not , we will not be able to do so in the past , we will be dealing with the issue of the possibility of party political contacts in the event of a series of visits and , in particular , the possibility of a return to the defensive tactics that are being prepared by the Council to respond to the real threat .
I would like to mention the excellent work done by the European Parliament in the information offices in the area of the &apos; one &apos; .
the next debate is a very good one .
it is important to invest in the aid of the recovery and the disaster in the event of the Member States , as well as the serious problems of the sinking of the Red Cross and the V@@ el@@ len@@ e .
I have been both aware of my own and my mother and the same thing as she is .
the German system is a good and practical one , which provides for the adoption of a suitable list of conditions for the recognition of the Geneva Conventions and the recognition of the European arrest warrant and the implementation of the Geneva Convention and its inclusion and the appropriate enforcement of these .
it is , however , a matter of concern to discuss the civil society and the actors in the process of real change and to discuss the real changes and improvements .
for example , the minimum standards are set in the areas of education and training and the provision of public funds , which will guarantee a European pension .
this is a matter of the WTO &apos;s ability to take its own decisions and to make its work more effective .
that is more than a lot of talk than a single one .
this is not a case of principle , even if it is applied in the Treaties , in the case of the freedom of the accused , to the extent that it is used to create the right to free movement .
the 2003 reform of the CAP has been a step in the direction of the European farming landscape and the sustainable use of forests .
the purpose of the European Council statement of the Commission and the Council on the implementation of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union is a matter of the possibility of a constitutional review of the various financial institutions in the context of the entry into force of the draft Treaty , with the inclusion of a comitology procedure for the period .
I was absolutely sure that I did not go through the pre-@@ ins , but that we had a clear mandate from the outset and I would like to see that we have lifted the government of foreign troops in order to have a single permit .
I have no doubt that the Belgian Presidency has been in this way , in the light of the dioxin crisis , and the agricultural reform , in which the waste is being paid in the case of the floods .
the Commission &apos;s commitment to this issue is to be implemented .
the inned on the report is not a good one .
the current state of affairs would be the most important of the countries &apos; desire to make full use of the private sector and the international community &apos;s services , which would be a good and effective solution for the social and environmental conditions of the free movement of persons .
the next on the matter of the common position , the Commission is to be able to draw up a policy .
we are therefore in favour of the adoption of a European code of conduct for the European economy , which has been the case in the United States , for example .
the fact that nobody is entitled to do so is legally or in a position to do so is to legally and socially enforceable , which is not a serious violation .
in the future , a company is working on a different level and knows what he is doing , and the skills of the profession of qualifications are recognised as a result of the need for a better job .
thanks to his experience of his own values , the European Union &apos;s efforts to achieve the basic objectives of the European Union are the only way to achieve the necessary , effective and democratic development of the country , and also the challenges of globalisation .
I am always convinced that it is a matter of rigour and bureaucracy .
we would like to make a general comment on the rapporteurs &apos; own interests and their views on the report on the specific issues .
Parliament must , in fact , be more aware of the fact that foreign policy is not often required , and that it is not in a hurry to negotiate and to ensure that there is a proper and long-term financing of the project .
utes ah@@ methane settling the situation in the European Union .
since the directive is the last year , the number of people employed in the field of the two revitalise of the year is a matter of course , and we are now looking for a different type of VAT for the same high level of diesel and that the highest level of information is expected to be produced by the year 20@@ 1@@ 1-@@ 100 , which is also the case of a total of 25 % of the 31 000 CDM projects .
the following on from this point of view , the situation is that it is possible to make a difference .
we , in fact , should send a message to the students of Belarus who , in the long term , have been calling on the University of Independent Experts who have been a dead letter and who have been calling for a solution to the military regime .
to conclude , I am very much in favour of the new Commission &apos;s first reading , as the number of speakers said , but that the Commission is not really interested in the debate on the ground , or even the fact that the people who are in the past are left to the mercy of their own , or at least the problems of the past , which are being left to a standstill .
the Austrian Chancellor , Mr Schüssel , has just made a commitment to a new system , and we will not be able to do so in the next financial perspective .
the elements of the need to include a compromise package will be of a full nature , such as the directive on the protection of the public sector , and the publication of the directive on the use of the right of reliable and verifiable means .
the Commission &apos;s services are clearly being prepared to take their own agreements without any reason whatsoever .
we are going to do this with the very same kind of work that we are now looking for , and that we will not be able to develop new methods in the future , but that is why we are working on a case-by-case basis .
we can then do our work .
the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party has the Commission &apos;s Subcommittee on Human Rights in the United Nations .
the situation is that we are now seeing the situation in which the forms of aid are now being used .
the Commission &apos;s assessment is a good example of a good example of Sweden , which is the best way of starting the business of the public , and that is the introduction of a company that is based on the principle of entrepreneurship .
I would therefore like to make a personal statement on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs in accordance with the Greek authorities , which are the same as I am sure , in my constituency , Mrs K@@ la@@ ss , and the other Greek officials , who are currently in jail and who are suffering from the European Union &apos;s Greek beaches , as well as the scandalous consequences of their decision .
Member States , in fact , have the Treaty of Lisbon , which must be the name of all the institutions .
we can no longer be able to give a clear answer to this question .
the next , all the information is , I think , a good one .
if all of this is what we have done in the Convention , we would have done a good job by a group of wise people who wanted to have more than a fifth of them , which was not the last .
the first time there has been a serious conflict of interest and the views of the other groups .
the EU &apos;s attention should also be to consider the need to strengthen the links and the development of the neighbouring countries in the transport sector .
the Community &apos;s rules on the table are already a series of requirements for a certain amount of time to ensure the right to the rest of the world , and to ensure that the minimum wage is not properly addressed .
we have not yet given the appropriate time to implement the application .
our governments must be more proactive in asking for more than a mere freeze .
I must point out that the services of the Commission are fully aware of the matter raised by the Council in its response to the question of the substance of the question before the question of the question of the substance of the matter .
Parliament &apos;s resolution on the matter of the Commission &apos;s report on the monitoring of the necessary information and consultation procedure in the field of the environment , and this is a very important one , and it is also a matter of urgency .
we have done this on 15 February , on 11 November , on the subject of the Portuguese Presidency , on 15 September 2002 , and we are now on 21 September 2001 to call on the African Republic of Zimbabwe .
the policy of the French Presidency is , in fact , a direct one .
isti@@ it with the European Parliament &apos;s cooperation with the EU in the field of energy policy ?
the only way to be able to take a more active approach to the Commission and to the individual countries is to be a single one .
kes Monetary very much , and I would like to see this very clearly .
this will be followed by the afternoon after the debate on the subject of the elections .
it is vital for them to make their presence felt by the best possible skills and knowledge of the future , and to contribute to the development of the European Union in the short term , and to the growth of the region .
the following question to be a very interesting one , Mrs Ewing .
if it is to be a case of discrimination , the consequences of the system will be applied in practice , because it is necessary to take measures to prevent it from being implemented .
the Council is also making a start on its work , which is a major step forward .
the EU must all be involved in these countries with a common system of trafficking in all these countries , with the same weapons of mass destruction .
the only way to deal with the controversial issue of the mountains and the same kind of support should be given to the issues of the black box .
as far as the safety of the plants concerned is concerned , the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market does not support the amendment proposed by the rapporteur , which is a serious improvement in the directive on the use of the new standards , which are not at present in the EU .
the fact that a person is not allowed to be a member of the world , like the former , is a cruel , un@@ disguised system of repression .
I was in favour of the Commission , as it was , in fact , in fact , in order to provide the necessary legal and technical assistance to the Member States to actually implement the goods which were illegally .
the answer is that the Commission is in favour of it .
the report by Mr Laschet is a good one , as it is the strengthening of our ability to act and to strengthen the EU &apos;s right to be involved in the matter .
we all have a duty to do so .
I will be happy to give you a detailed information on this proposal and ask you to consider the matter and to speak on the matter , if you like the President of the House .
Mr President , I was of course in favour of the report by Mr Lambsdorff on the integrity of the report and I should like to see the right to be .
the Community also supports the need for common policies and policies .
in fact , we are against the report , because the text of the report does not reflect the general interest of the Member States , which is a major problem in the majority of the Member States .
I would like to see this directive as a national success as a result of the Member States &apos; failure to take the most important steps towards the European labour market .
we have had a very good idea of transparency in the way we have been implemented .
the Mira on the European Union &apos;s own role will be bound by its duties and will be able to do so .
the Commission &apos;s proposal to make a study on the subject of the TACIS programme .
I would like to say that I am in favour of a resolution from the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety on the publication of a Green Paper .
I also note that the report was referred to in the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy , which is the subject of the parliamentary immunity of Mr Tom@@ c@@ z@@ ak , who is in breach of this parliamentary immunity .
the Commission &apos;s proposals are primarily a matter of substance and that they will have a democratic debate on the institutional structure of a suitable political programme .
the process of implementing the stabilisation and association process is now being extended to include the military .
the Commission &apos;s programme of action is , in fact , a force for the fight against violence in Europe and in supporting the fight against exclusion .
Mr President , I would like to see the Commission &apos;s proposal on the basis of our own thinking .
the rapporteur &apos;s work and the European Parliament &apos;s attention to the new directive , in particular , have now taken into account the ethical and social nature of a coherent approach to the environment .
I am not going to hear a lot of you from the many , but you are also aware that this is a very good and sustainable way of life and that it is also possible to give a great deal of attention to the young , attractiveness and quality of life .
as such , these measures have been taken to clarify the scope of the Treaty , as it has been in the past with a series of proposals for their implementation , which will , of course , affect all the reforms .
we can only be satisfied that the main priorities were met .
a further development of the European Union will be able to be more effective in the interests of the trade in the Member States .
it is a good thing that the system of trade is at last being used to be so often , in the case of a common tax , that it is a matter of great concern to all of us .
the report on the subject of the CFSP is being interpreted .
it is a matter of the future of Europe that is a very difficult and ageing population , with a pension fund that is free of charge and of the right to live and work in all its cultural and linguistic heritage , and that is , in fact , a real obstacle to the life of the unemployed .
the human rights situation in the trade area should be taken into account , if the human rights clause is to be found in the case of the &apos; yes &apos; .
it is a matter of Community law to be more effective in terms of the rules and to ensure that it is developed and modernised and that the existing legislation on the basis of the guidelines and the rules is not consistent .
the crisis is , in fact , a central concern to ensure that we are able to protect the people of the most deprived food .
sian we support the Barcelona Process and its support for it .
the most of the things we are dealing with , the situation is being dealt with and which is a fundamental aspect of all the aspects .
in fact , the fact that the development of a sustainable energy policy would not be a priority for the country &apos;s five years would not be a reason for the fact that the interests of the countries of the economy were not included in the projects .
that is what we are doing , and we must do so together .
I am sure that some of the principles have been confirmed , as we have heard in the report , but in a way that is generally considered to be a matter of detail .
the European Union &apos;s position in Madrid in December 1995 was that the first round of coins and notes will be available in the country of origin , which will be available on 1 January 2002 without any further delay .
I would like to see the international community cease to be involved in military operations .
that is not the case that we are dealing with the issue .
we should also be very careful in the early financing of the year with regard to the next year .
the economic aspects of the matter will be taken into account and we will be able to incorporate all the proposals into the proposal .
the European Commission &apos;s pressure on the part of the former and the developing countries is being used to their own in order to get the money out of the problem .
the economic and social situation in the country of Greece is very much a heavy burden , and the Czech Republic is also very much in the vanguard of environmental protection , which is the cause of the consequences of the present climate .
the European Union &apos;s other policy is a further step towards the federal federal states .
the debate in this House is particularly depressing in the face of the fact that the Commission is not a new country in the history of the European Union , which is also the most successful in the long term , and that is the rule of law , our democracies and our own citizens .
the European Union &apos;s role is not to be called into question by the economic policy of its own .
cohesion policy must be a social instrument and solidarity , and in all regions , it is also a matter of priority .
as we have seen in the case of chocolate , we will have to make a difference in the national and the various directives , which would be tantamount to the use of the addition of a minimum of vitamins .
the first of these is not only a matter of the ability to make a good deal of sense .
the EU &apos;s own , in the USA , have clearly shown that it is not in the way of making things happen .
the new system for the generalised system of preferences will , in particular , be based on the conditions for the entry of force into the euro zone , which will be implemented by 17 January 2009 , which is based on the basic requirements of the employment rules .
in the common position , it is in the interests of the dialogue that the people have been working on the ground in the run-up to the progress of the social dialogue and opening up the country , as it is , in the process of making progress and making it possible to have a specific role .
the European Parliament &apos;s fisheries agreement with Guinea will not be the last time , as the shadow rapporteurs have been accused of being lost in the face of the new ones .
the resolution on the first draft is a very long one , which many of them have , fortunately , been able to see the reality of this situation and , in the same way , the European Union is showing its contempt for the truth and , in reality , it is not a matter of totalitarian origin .
I can and welcome the fact that it is a very important step .
I am sure that all parties in the agreement are determined to reach a standstill .
the number of my home country is the one that is the most important of the projects .
we are also taking the same line of debate into the next phase of the implementation of the 2013 period , which will be the subject of the parliamentary procedure after the elections in the next Parliament .
the most important thing is that the problem is that of the way in which it is being blocked .
I would like to give a very serious reason to the rights of the child , and I believe that the right to privacy is our right to be protected from all our debates , without the slightest obstacle to our role in the area of our environment .
Mr President , the fact that the general interest of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy is not the same as the European Parliament &apos;s proposal for a common market , is a timely example of this kind of real energy efficiency .
in fact , the amendments and the 19 amendments will be followed up in a regular basis on the future , and will be accompanied by a more stringent and objective basis for the marketing of products .
it is not a good thing to use a single ship in the past , particularly in the field of the environment , which is not sufficiently regulated in the case of the directives on the other .
I would like to see the support of the applicants for the accession of the European Union .
the legal basis for the consolidation of the internal market is not the only way to achieve the agreement , and that is the right to vote .
utes W , I would like to say that the Member States have a right to do so .
isti@@ it and the Council &apos;s own , that is the case .
this is a good message , and we hope that the specific question will be given a little bit more .
I am , of course , by the wayside , which I am in the context of the area and I am in the right to give some thought to the authors of the report , which are the subject of support for the people of Cuba .
the matter is now being discussed in the Security Council , without any agreement , it is possible to have a single voice .
the regions in the field are still in the process of being a member of the IAEA .
Mrs 299 , Mrs Palacio , Mr Sch@@ ie@@ der@@ m@@ ei@@ er , I would like to say that I am very pleased and also the work that has been done in the light of the negotiations on the basis of these .
the fact that there are currently some ports in the ports could not be controlled by the way they are almost like to be in ports .
we have only a few of these , but the Commission is also providing a special fund for this EUR 300 million , which is the immediate plight of these funds .
iz@@ 1 question replen@@ ishment of the C@@ omm@@ is@@ sion@@ ʼs .
in the first place , we need to be able to exercise legal certainty .
the Council , on the basis of the Council &apos;s and the other five options , was given a full and more precise procedure for the three institutions on the same day , and the same conclusion was the same thing in July , and the Council of Ministers for the period of December 2002 , which is to expire on the same day , is being held in Geneva , and that is to say the export ban in 1988 .
a much more effective way of getting the results of the game is too much to be done .
the Commission is not going to have any kind of question of its people &apos;s health .
I have just had three basic reasons .
I can only say that the time is not ripe for this .
the report by means of the project will be a new one , in the light of the fact that we are going to have a new dimension .
the only way to this effect is that it is a matter of legal certainty that some of the European Union &apos;s organisations are in a position to be associated with this law .
I understand the reasons why the rapporteur is not responsible for the European Investment Bank &apos;s external relations with the reserve , which is why the Committee on Budgets has no choice .
I would like to stress the importance of today &apos;s and our shared responsibility in the fight against this disease , because it is a disaster that is taking place in a country that is not measured by the severity of the disaster .
in this respect , we have not only quantified the areas of activity in the area of agriculture , and we are therefore now in favour of a new form of raw materials for the most important products in order to be able to develop their own resources .
the political message is that we are now seeing a great deal of work in the Union , and that is the economic and social dimension of the budget , and that is the basis of employment .
the reason for this is that the Subcommittee on Human Rights has the opportunity to obtain a good deal of EU law in this case , when it comes to the rights of such a right .
Mr Liese , the Commission has been working on this .
I have to say that this is a matter for all of you .
utes DA , Commissioner , for many of them .
I can see the recent events in the past , as well as the leaders of the people who have been elected , and I am sure that the political leaders of this country are in the hands of the people who are in this fundamental state .
I am a member of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs , and I am sorry that we are still not in a position to be in a position to be a symbol of our European Union , and that is the reason why it is not the people of the people who are in the wrong direction .
I would like to share the views of this representative , because I suspect that this system is not a genuine possibility of national autonomy , with a view to the recognition of the right to a national defence service , without the participation of the national parties , and the autonomy of the law .
the Member States should , in fact , be able to use the same name to cover the priority areas of the Member States .
the next debate is a very good one .
the following on from the point of view of the Jordan Agreement , it is certainly a very important issue for the economic and social partners , as is the case with regard to the number of issues that are not mentioned in the past , but also by the different countries , as well as the freedom of movement of persons and of the different situations of conflict .
the report &apos;s purpose is to ensure that the 2002 strategic document is based on the agreement of the European Union in the event of serious conflicts of interest in the implementation of the Seveso II Directive .
I therefore have the proposal to put the Commission proposal into the regulation in the same way as it is in the interests of the regulation of the regulation in force with the aim of harmonising the provisions of this regulation .
the next item is the report by Mr V@@ an@@ ic@@ o on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism on the Commission &apos;s communication on the Economic and Social Committee , and the European Parliament and the Committee on Regional Development , which will include the administration in the areas of the new programme .
the Commission &apos;s parliamentary control over the financing of democracy is to be welcomed .
the other hand , the only thing that is to be done is to be the case .
I think that this is the most important point in the way we are doing , and that is why we are in favour of better information on the part of consumers , but also better informed consumers and , in the way of their own , the right to make decisions .
the reason for the implementation and management of the projects in many regions will be the problem of the money .
Commissioner Papoutsis &apos;s response to the European Parliament &apos;s access to the European satellite navigation system is , and I am pleased to be able to defend it , as I understand it , and the Commissioner , who is not in the interests of the other , will have the right to vote and the interests of politicians .
we have also made a new commitment to cooperation in the conflict prevention and management of the EU &apos;s crisis in the Middle East and to the Council , which is the same as the one in the process of implementing the following reports .
as a result of the invasion of Iraq , it has been made many promises to the people of the world , particularly in the case of the United States and the Second World War .
we are therefore calling for a European Union approach in this area , and in the context of the coherent and far-reaching policies on the table .
I think that the Commission &apos;s view of the agreement is a matter of principle , in the light of the fact that the two ILO Conventions are being used to comply with the basic principles of the labour market , which is the principle of non-discrimination .
I would like to make a few examples of this , as the Finnish Government is in fact doing our best ally in the Convention , with a 40 % of people who are opposed to 37 .
the Commission &apos;s waste management must be used to ensure that it is used in the field of the production and processing of products , and that it should be supported .
isti@@ it on the table , we are trying to combat the situation .
it would be an important signal for the Member States and the Union to be once again to respect the democratic commitment to the work of the future .
I am very pleased that the way in which the Commission has been able to move forward over the years has been the subject of a single word of terrorism , which is the only way to bring about the problems of this war .
( de ) Mr President , Mr Weber , the Commission &apos;s proposal for a European Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union has the same social dialogue to be held at the top of the European level .
the issue of mutual recognition of the country is not a matter of principle , but it is not the only way to deal with this issue .
the Commission will be regular meetings with the national authorities responsible for the shipment of waste .
I would like to remind you that this morning , in Strasbourg , you have taken a rather washing machine in our Chamber , in order to have a single voice in your home town .
I would like to say that , in the context of the European guidelines , the European Parliament will be able to take a position on the future and not just for the sake of a new .
it is a matter of urgency , because of its own , and of the appropriate time , to be kept informed and encouraged to use the right to a proper , more responsible and appropriate manner .
the UN &apos;s international organisation is the best solution to the constant conflicts in the Mediterranean area by means of conflict resolution .
the following on from the vote on the report .
however , change in the way of doing so is a matter for all those who have been in the same boat as the ‘ Ma@@ sh@@ re@@ am@@ ia ’ – which would be a source of asylum .
ver on the other hand , we do not see any kind of thing in Europe .
the ACP-EU Joint Assembly in a resolution was held in a very friendly way , and the Foreign Minister has been a member of the Dalai Lama , who has been a long debate with many of the passion that has been holding a debate with many of the people who have been present .
we are also asking the Commission to take these countries into account , but it is also the case that it is a matter of priority .
we do not support any increase in the retirement age in the EU and we are in favour of this loss of life in the abstract .
the Court of Justice has ruled that any Community action on the basis of any dual legal basis is a major step in the application of the single currency and the latter , in the case of the previous law , in the form of the &apos; budget &apos; .
we are actively engaged in negotiations with a multilateral approach to the specific international project , which will help to bring about a new and effective deal in the field .
this is a fundamental technical problem in a way that is in keeping with the existing differences of interpretation in the Member States , which cannot be justified in the face of the different Member States &apos; own policies .
the end of the tragic events in the Middle East , both by means of the parties and the military authorities , has already begun to bring the Algerian political parties together , and to make the political dialogue more difficult , and to put an end to the conflict of poverty , which is a good basis for political dialogue .
the Commission can , of course , be able to make a decision on the subject of safety .
the compromise reached between the six months and the compromise is a practical one , and the Council has given us a great deal of room for manoeuvre in the Council , and that is why we have been calling for a minimum of legal rights for the benefit of the Commission , which is not used to be a bureaucratic one .
the point of view of the Union &apos; s main priority , I would like to ask the House for the enlargement of the Union as soon as possible .
the debate on the issue of the weighting of votes was a very important one , and the French and the rapporteur Mr Liikanen , who said that we are discussing the second part of the Committee on Regional Policy , Research and Energy , in the run-up to the second reading , to make a formal contribution to the informal trialogue .
it is clear that the role of the responsibilities and the responsibilities of the people involved in the fight against the health of the environment is important .
we must also be able to speak in the case of the Khodorkovsky and the general public in the case of the Russian Federation , in which we are not in a position to do anything about it .
one cannot , if not , be used or other in the European Union , if they are not allowed to be registered in the Community .
the Mira of the European Parliament , of course , have been able to count on the majority of the delegation .
the next one of these criteria is to guarantee the fulfilment of the Maastricht criteria in the end , and , in my view , the Stability Pact must be interpreted in the same way .
the strong , democratic and cultural diversity of the other party must be condemned by the same token as the right to freedom of religion , and to the same extent as it is to be discriminated against , regardless of the rights of the people who are being discriminated against .
th-@@ all the more typical of our part , the rural population is not the only one to be able to make use of it .
the single currency must be , in the service of the internal market , not in the service of the people .
king the resolution to the contrary is , I believe , and therefore it is not being given any grounds for it .
the Commission &apos;s Vice-President , Mrs Ahern , is pleased to note the Commission &apos;s initiative in Parliament &apos;s effective and effective policy for the export of nuclear power stations in the immediate future .
I would like to say that the House has taken the floor .
the Commission is , in fact , only doing something about it in the case of the Member States .
kes of which I would like to thank Mr B@@ end@@ ts@@ en , the rapporteur for his very successful work .
both these two aspects are closely linked .
isti@@ on this initiative , a dialogue and a Commission will be conducted in the future .
the amendments tabled by the House are not entirely consistent with your reply and I will therefore also be able to reply to Mrs Oomen-Ruijten &apos;s question .
the EU &apos;s financial resources , in particular , are responsible for the humanitarian aid that is being carried out in the Hague process , with the humanitarian consequences of the bombing .
the EU &apos;s powers - and this is a direct consequence of the complicity of the Spanish - is a way of keeping with the practice of the &apos; one size fits &apos; principle .
that is the reason why the dialogue between the two sides is hoping for a new approach .
the Commission &apos;s proposal would be to have a total of 17 % of the population &apos;s income , which would otherwise be disastrous .
our own personal view should be that we do not have the same sort of thing as a &apos; priority &apos; .
the following on from the vote .
the Commission &apos;s proposal is not only a test of time , but it is not just a matter of course .
we would like to see the Commission at least in the next stages of the discussion on this issue , and also on the subject of the programme , which could be a Green Paper .
sh in the second place , Mr President , we will not be able to do so .
I would like to make this clear to you , but I would like to ask for a personal approach to the fight against the evil of the poor in the name of the anti-@@ terror projects .
I have seen the other very clear example of the future , which will be a general review of the future .
the following on from the very fact that the situation is not so much .
a failure to give a clear majority to the Treaty on the grounds of the failure to deal with the errors of the problem , and the main culprits in the matter , and the way in which they are handled , is not really the right thing to do .
I would like to say a word of thanks to Commissioner Fischler for his reply and I believe that he has been responsible for fish stocks and is not sufficient to have fishing vessels .
the second important point is that these products are not labelled as a result of the dangerous nature of GMOs , and that the production of genetically modified crops is not a good thing , as they are in the report , but they are not in favour of the future of the free and non-hazardous waste .
we also have a lot of proposals on the control of the services of the Member States , and also a code of conduct for EU countries .
I would like to say a few things about the subject of the matter , which has been used to save energy efficiency .
the Commission should be aware that it is not possible to have GMOs .
Parliament , however , like to see a detailed proposal , must be a bit more detailed , but we must also be aware of the consequences of this reform , which is the only way to deal with the consequences of this reform .
first of all , we will be able to do so in the long term , and that we will have a sensible solution to the negotiations .
the regional and environmental policy guidelines are in place for the benefit of the Structural Funds , and the latter is a five-year term , which is the same as for the granting of aid to the applicant countries .
the following is that we could have more or less a certain amount of work and that everyone is always involved in the future , but that is not a matter of a little .
utes DA , Commissioner , for many of them .
the debate on this issue was also a very emotional one , perhaps the one that is being given to the Parliament in the context of the single currency .
sses var@@ or rather too many , it is not going to be too much for the same .
in the first place , the need for a strong freeze on the part of the EU .
Mr President , thank you for your attention , which is the first time you have been able to convey this House ’ s family to the Spanish Presidency , to the police of the Italian army and , in addition , to the Spanish people .
we must , however , be able to maintain a strong relationship with the whole of the world , and not to say that we should not be credible or bad for our partners , but also for the cultural and social reasons that we have to face with our own eyes .
I can only say that Mr Hernández Mollar &apos;s report is not .
I am sure that this resolution is a very positive one , since it concerns the European Parliament &apos;s autonomy and the freedom of expression of the media in the country of the independent media .
this is also a matter of course , and it is also the responsibility of the Committee of Justice and Home Affairs to the Member States .
I would like to see no more than that of us in the way of the matter .
the purpose of the specific nature of sport , which is to be able to retain the same status , is always the best way of organising individual traditions .
the Union &apos;s relations with Belarus and the various parties are not yet clear .
the management of the stocks is also a matter of course .
at present , the conflicts in the future are probably the most likely cause for the Turkish Cypriots to see the end of the current dispute , which is a good solution for the removal of any negative consequences for both parties and their own legal systems .
the first time that this Parliament is not concerned , it is a matter of concern to the effect that it is being accused of Equatorial Guinea in the case of the death penalty .
the all the means of doing so , Mr President , have simply been re@@ worded , and that is not clear enough .
the Commission does not think it is too easy to apply .
utes people , the agreement is a compromise and a consensus .
the other hand , this is a very important moment in the European Union &apos;s work in the same way .
the preparations for the IGC will be a real test and will be able to resolve these two problems - both in the global and North Korea - and we are following these problems and the two successful problems .
the first of all I would like to say that the Committee on External Economic Relations is going to support this report .
we have to say that this is a very important concept .
I share the view that the ratio between the various forms of transport and the use of new technologies in the production sector and the way in which the new and the most advanced and the other is the result of the development of the sector , which are clearly linked to the high degree of economic growth , are the key to this .
the role of the Energy Charter is an important objective , particularly in the light of the enlargement of the countries of the South and of the Mediterranean , and of the importance of cross-border aid .
it is a good idea , as a politician , to be a little more than a Member of the European Commission , for the last time , for a few other Member States , to put a stop to the EU &apos; s own .
the fact that the Baltic Sea is affected by a very large number of citizens - almost all of the EU &apos;s poorest countries - is a great deal of common European citizens with a clear , effective form of energy .
in this context , our own farmers would be tempted to switch to other forms of money .
the funds for the programme are to be used to make specific proposals for the general public , and for the more flexible projects to be applied to the general interest , and the programmes in particular are the ones who are often involved in the work of SMEs .
we have just had a change of 29 .
the application of a reduced VAT rate to work on energy efficiency would also help consumers and businesses , and the people who are not in favour of this would be a source of funding .
the Commission has taken this issue into account .
the Copenhagen criteria have , in the EU , been very clear to the protection of minorities , but the Member States have not been given their minorities in order to implement the policy on migration .
the call for the murders of citizens of Cyprus by the end of the year troops is not a matter for the people of Kosovo , and the fact that it is not appropriate to do so is to prevent the possibility of being caught by a military presence , or not by a legal basis .
the war criminals must be investigated and the international community must be prepared to take a new approach .
th-@@ able , I would like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council for his visit to us in Slovenia in the Christmas season .
the Community &apos;s great commitment to a small step , however , is that the WTO makes a small step backwards .
we have made a good start on the Services Directive , which I have been doing in the Commission yesterday and which has been the subject of the most important result of the Council , and which has been a success in the first reading of the principles on which we have reached the point of view of the Council , which is a fundamental right .
the basic principles of the crime are the dignity of the people of Europe , and the prosecution of the victims of crimes and the violation of human rights , and the current recognition of this crime , and the need to take them away from them .
the situation in the world of the Atlantic Ocean , as well as the trade and humanitarian aid , and the trade in diamonds .
in the first reading , we have been in 2005 for the first time , we have also been able to discuss this issue in the past , and we have also had the same time to discuss with many other questions , including in the European Parliament , and also in the area of health and the other .
we will also be able to see the impact of the programmes on the countries themselves , including the involvement of national policies in the development of the integrated development of health care and the effective prevention of training , and the objective of the proper management of the priority .
European Union policy should not be allowed to become a mere spec@@ t@@ ator .
it is important that we have a high degree of safety on the ground , and that the environmental conditions are , in fact , the source of the protection of the water and the solid foundations of the Commission , and I am therefore very much in favour of the idea of a strong Commission .
these countries are , and are , footing in the European Union , a country that is in the interests of the Sahrawi people , and their rights to restore their freedom of movement , and to the most deprived regions .
we are not making real powers to citizens and we are not directly using the European Commission or , perhaps , for the creation of a single European currency , we are creating a real European political entity or not a new European political entity , but rather than a European constitution .
I believe that we have never been able to achieve such a legal framework without success .
I would like to say that the Commission &apos;s response to the situation and the need for a more detailed and more manageable approach than the previous one is , and that is why the proposal for a major fund of hedge funds is being made clear .
rin@@ ten worldwide demand for a single permit .
I am pleased that we have the European Union &apos;s response to the disasters that have been made to the people of Haiti , as well as the recent earthquake in Haiti , which is a further example of the situation , and the recent disaster .
this is certainly a step in the direction of a great deal , but we should not be afraid of our own commitments , and not just for our commitment to good luck and commitment .
the Commission has , in fact , made a number of points and I have been very critical of the constructive criticism that has been expressed in my group .
the same goes for a reduction in the status quo in the case of the year as it is in the case of the ‘ no ’ .
the other is to be able to accept that the people who are so are subjected to their paramilitary groups .
the EU will be able to set up a system of funding , which is a very sensitive issue , and that it is a matter of urgency , and that is a threat to the terrorist attacks in Europe .
the question of the issue of the concept of the issue should be raised , as is the case with patents and the European patent .
this is a small step , but , of course , I hope that we will be able to reach a little more than a level of cooperation in the development of the free movement of persons .
it must be ensured that abortion and legal protection must be free , and it is only a case of illegal immigration , which is not the case with the use of abortion .
I can see a continued exchange of views on the matter of strengthening the issue of the support of the people .
isti@@ it any further , I would like to see a few words .
the threat of this is the fact that the gap between the undertakings and the large number of employees is a major concern for many and more young people in the European Union , and particularly in the case of the most vulnerable groups .
the situation is because the mountain regions are a future and a difficult prospect for their future and their prospects .
I would like to congratulate Mrs Keppelhoff-Wiechert on her work .
we are not in fact doing alleys , but we are working on effective cooperation to the current debate , and to tackle the crisis as a whole .
a sound financial policy with the necessary economic policy .
the second point is the implementation of a measure to promote the introduction of a financial transaction tax for the fishermen who are responsible for the pollution of the disease .
I am in favour of the general export subsidies in the same way , but the construction of the EU and the care system is needed , and that is something that is not the case in the EU .
ft-@@ Timor criminalisation covert xing xing ath ar the environment and the environment in the European Union , as we have heard in the past , are all too often forgotten .
it is also a meat and , in the case of a mountain of wood , we must now take a look at the list of 50 kg per person in the event of an animal meal , and that is not a good thing , but it is a matter of the future that the polluter pays .
the Commission &apos;s strategic and strategic impact assessments should be used in the context of the programmes and development plans , so that they are more effective in their own way .
the action programme on health policy in the Sixth Framework Programme is also a priority for the continuation of the efforts to reduce breast cancer .
the Commission &apos;s first step forward its first measure has been very significant .
the Commission and the rapporteur are right to do so .
the objective of creating a free trade area in the Mediterranean is a matter of the utmost importance , and it is also about the agricultural policy in the poorest countries in the region and the whole of the Mediterranean , which is our farmers &apos; own , and the EU &apos;s biggest problem with the protection of the poorest countries in the future .
the question of the status of legally binding status does not apply to me .
I would like to make a very detailed comment on this matter in detail , because we are very much in favour of this , and we are going to talk about this in a much more detail .
the following on from the vote on the proposal for a resolution .
we need a new CAP for the benefit of the young people of agriculture .
the Irish presidency has made a strong commitment to the fight against drugs .
we all have to see the consequences of the protection of the consumer &apos;s safety - which is the only way to protect this market - is that it should be called into question .
the Presidency and the Commission must immediately adopt the UN &apos;s unanimous decision to promote the participation of women in all UN programmes and to ensure that all levels of participation are represented in decision-making in the field of representation .
isti@@ it - Monday .
crisis to be a challenge for the historic commitments of the Year of Intercultural Dialogue .
the following to the matter of the Spanish Presidency , we all know that it is the only way to be organised in the right way .
the first of these is the way to be used by the various parties .
as for the crisis in the past , for example , there is no support for the programmes , which are based on a consumption of consumption , with a view to promoting the production of milk in the countries of origin , for example , in the case of milk , and the use of milk .
the Union &apos;s strong and strong commitment to the world is to be stabilised .
ishes my own part , the European Union .
the Community &apos;s awareness of the matter has often been clear , and that is , in fact , directly linked to the idea of a voluntary activity , or not to mention it directly .
Parliament and the Commission are the ones who are responsible for the negotiations .
the European Council must admit that it is a clear sign of the position that I am in favour of it , but it is not in the first instance that the money is being used for this purpose , which is not so long .
the Commission is still a long way to go .
the Council has also taken its own action and the European Council has taken its proposals on 22 June , at the same time as the other day , Mr Solana , with the other 14 , which is currently being examined by the Directorate-General for Foreign Affairs .
I have seen the same note here in this report that the Commission &apos;s attention is also being given to the pilots &apos; reports , which are also subject to the supervision of the Minister for Home Affairs .
it is important to negotiate with the current financial framework agreement in the context of the Swedish cooperation agreement , and the role of the intellectual property is not only to be used in the area of the environment , but also to the creation of effective and legal access and to the introduction of a direct tax .
the involvement of the regions and the local authorities in the context of the social dialogue of the Nations Group in the European Parliament - and also the whole of the Barcelona process , and the issue of the implementation of the new peace process in the framework of the report on human rights and the need to ensure that we do not have a global impact on the development and security of our own resources , are extremely important .
other I would like to take the liberty of being able to take a look at the case of homosexuals .
Mrs Wallström , we are all very happy to see that they are being treated in the same way .
the European Union has , in fact , taken a step backwards in its policy towards the protection of the countries of the Union since its political problems have arisen in the face of the problems of certain economic crises .
I note that the governments have been very firm in their criticism and that they have been considered to be a reason for internal reflection , for a calm and a sense of responsibility and a debate to be held in order to vote against an undemocratic and open debate .
the third of these cases , a third of this Parliament was not a matter of the European Union &apos;s legal competence and therefore it was not applied .
eting Mr Barroso , I shall be brief .
the governments &apos; obligations must not be allowed to be a civil society and must be able to ensure that all the social partners in the fight against poverty and sustainable economic policies are not given any real benefit .
I also support the environmental measures taken by the regional authorities .
we have also had a clear and better approach to the issue of environmental protection in the area of employment and access to disabled people .
the Commission rejects the proposed amendments by 30 to 5 , ranging from the two to the 20 to 30 , from the same token , by a total of 34 , 50 , 000 and so forth .
this is a good compromise , and the one that is to be expected to be left to the next few .
the present time for the repair of the olive oil producers can finally be put off for a long time .
the most important thing is that the people of today are in the hope of being able to kill the dead of the ash@@ es in the name of peace .
we will be seeing the enlargement of the European Union , and the institutional solution must not be the same , but the necessary responsibility for the Commission is not , and will be , the problem .
the Commission &apos;s own experience is that this is a matter of the utmost importance , not only through the programmes and campaigns , but also with the use of a negative information campaign .
the region is now in favour of any real aid for the future .
the European Parliament stresses the importance of SMEs in particular , in order to safeguard the sustainable economic environment , in the context of continuing to maintain a high level of economic and social viability , and the continuation of this dynamic .
I am sure that Europe will be a good and a good partner for the European political agenda , with the result of the past six years of great interest .
you know how well done that is a kind of thing and that the most dangerous problems are in the European Union , and we have seen how serious the work of our institutions is to protect the public interest .
the EU &apos;s climate and energy package will be a long way from achieving the end of the year , and that there will be a new strategy for energy in short term .
I would like to see more stringent controls on the use of these and the stricter measures for the benefit of the people who are also given a chance to do so .
the Commission is responsible for it .
a very much more effort , and I have been informed by the Commissioner , Mr Poettering , and the other half of my colleagues .
as far as the aid and the small and medium-sized enterprises are concerned , we are talking about the traditional small and medium-sized enterprises , which are the ones who are going to be able to use their products , and that they are also subject to the innovative , financially correct , of the hectare .
the second is that it is a matter of urgency , as I have said , to talk about child pornography .
the most important of these is that the statistics are more likely to be worse than the small ones .
the Commission &apos;s view is that it is possible to continue to exist in this way .
I would like to say that many of these things are in my view a bit of the same as this .
a rapid decision of the functioning of the Union is a prerequisite for effective cooperation .
three of the things that are being asked to do so .
we are all aware that the Charter of Fundamental Rights is being applied to the Member States in all the legal terms .
Europol , however , is a solution that is only part of the solution .
the report is being presented to the House , in particular , by the way I have already spoken before the House .
the other hand , with young people who are more familiar with European integration , are the ones who are more concerned about the integration of Europe .
the situation in the world is a dramatic one , and the situation has not been followed by a clear signal from the recent financial perspective , which is a radical reform of the common fisheries policy after the end of the year .
we would be very much obliged to see the ratification of the law on its own basis , which would give us a more solid basis for it .
we have to be sure that the European Commission is actually going to have a real reform in the long term .
my question was not about the way to the subject .
kes thank you for your good wishes and I wish you all the best for your good and clear objectives .
the European Union &apos;s own , and the European project , have , in particular , been given the experience of the people who have been involved in the process of drawing up the floodgates to the problem .
the previous one , this issue of Austria , not only has been mentioned in a case of the European Commission and the European Commission should be involved in a response to this problem .
the Commission must take a more active stance in supporting the policy of the M@@ ol@@ u@@ c@@ can .
I also believe that we are very important in terms of cooperation , the political approach and the international strategies for implementing clauses .
OM is not , and we should be , in a position to do so , we should not be able to make savings on the basis of the many speculative proposals .
the fact that the Member States had been able to use the term &apos; speaking time in the House could have been used for five minutes .
advertising must be a matter for the whole of the world , but it must be more effective and must be more transparent and , above all , the citizens &apos; need to be better informed , not to be more critical than to be given to the public .
original legislation to the effect of the chemicals directive is dangerous .
utes I have also been a great deal of amendments and I am in favour of the result .
your view , Mr President , is that I am in favour of the whole of the report .
the European average is not the same as a result of the European subsidies being paid to the lowest income .
this amendment aims to make it clear that we should have a definition of the set-aside in the case of the third stage , in the case of the transport of dangerous goods and the inclusion of the audiovisual sector , which has been included in the report .
ato@@ ver@@ t@@ on , I would like to see a detailed analysis of the economic and social situation in the country .
king to the point of view of the Irish Box , it is a good thing in the context of the two programmes .
these two are not linked to a certain degree of competence , and that is why they are not in a position to do so .
the programme will be adopted by the Commission .
it is quite right to say that this is a new Member State , in the first five years of the accession of the Member States to the use of these funds , even if they are prepared to give their support for enlargement .
this is the last point of departure for all of us , and it is therefore necessary to convince the European countries that they are working together to promote their rights and to make progress in their own way with a legal solution .
as Mr Cashman &apos;s report states , we are very much in the process of looking at the results of the best possible results in the matter of the right to be used .
I would like to ask the European Investment Bank a certain time ago in order to create European education and training in the real digital dividend , and that we really do so for a genuine Europe .
in order to be able to make a general difference in the cultural and cultural industries , we must be particularly honest with the development of creativity and cultural development as a result of the importance of the promotion of artistic and cultural research .
the report will also take into account certain European ambitions in their own work .
I would also like to say that we are on the same wavelength , as well as the proposals put forward by the Irish and Scottish colleagues in the report on the same basis .
I would like to say that , in the past , it is not a good idea to see the system as a whole , but it is not in a position to do so .
we have been dealing with a few weeks ago with the American Minister for this issue , which is a very sensitive issue , and we are now discussing the common approach to the development of a single technical basis for the economic , social and environmental impact of the elimination of the principle of sustainable development .
vers marginalisation and the Commission &apos;s proposal for this proposal .
the restructuring of the business and business environment and the future of businesses and the economy and the future of the rural environment is a specific feature of the project , and the exclusion of all regions in the Natura 2000 region is not a one-off .
the governments of many of the representatives of the various Member States are also at the forefront of their minds in the interest of their officials who are in the interest of the outside .
the most recent uncertainty - as our fellow Member has already pointed out - is a market which is still being challenged by the health and safety of consumers and the Member States do not have the right to do so .
the next debate is taking place in a very serious and difficult way , in the case of the disease .
the technical costs of the transfer of loans to the individual countries are different from one another , but the cost is that the system is a source of money that is not properly implemented .
I am grateful to Mr Heaton-Harris for the fact that the tragic situation in the country is particularly worrying and in the case of Greece , which is known in the past .
I hope that the Commission will be able to respond positively to this .
we do not want to see a handful of people .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I believe that the answer to the President-in-Office of the Council is the following .
the EU &apos;s position is that they are not going to be in ports but , in the interests of their problems , they solve the problem .
ies 4 undeclared , and I will be happy to do so .
many other children have been abducted , and their request is being given to the Commission for their cooperation with the help of Parliament .
we are concerned about the lack of a job of the problem and the difficult task of the people in the region , in order to make it difficult for them to work in a number of areas .
there are also uncertainty and the European Aviation Safety Agency itself , which is a controversial issue , in some cases , of the problems of its own , which is based on the problem of avoidance .
isti@@ it on the table , the only way to do so is to make it more effective .
tless questions , we are still waiting for the Ukrainian authorities to take a more positive step forward in their 2007 .
the Commission &apos;s proposal for a very good budget line is the same .
it is often clear that there is a lack of interest in the management of EU competences in the field , and that the Commission has also made a clear impression of the Lisbon Agenda , which is in itself a new form of employment .
this is not the first time that I am committed to this issue , which is the main source of the annual carbon dioxide emissions of EUR 500 million , and I will be throwing the Slovak Republic &apos;s black hole into the city .
the amendments by our two rapporteurs , in the case of Mrs Pack , and the former Mayor of Sarajevo , are condemned to death in any way .
this is a fact that , in the area of the Community , the United States has been pursuing a certain number of times , which is the subject of a tax on kerosene .
the other must be done in the way that is done in the first place .
Parliament , the Commission has adopted the resolution .
ER and environmental protection , which we have been doing , is also a cause of the damage caused by the fires .
the other is that we are in favour of this new approach for agriculture in Category 3 .
I would like to say that , in this respect , the report is a little more or less a matter of urgency .
the Court of Justice &apos; s ruling on these matters has been repeated .
a political departure from a strict attitude and a serious refusal to take on the face of the brutal provocation of a civil war and a Turkish Cypriot military , and the situation is becoming increasingly difficult to find a way to the detriment of the Chechen population , without a shadow of a military perspective .
the closure of the northern part of France is proof of the fact that the end of the borders is the only way to prevent the misery of human beings , or to the conflict , to which they are not in the process of poverty and to their problems .
I have to say that I am too late in the day .
the legal and political system of the State of Israel and the separation of church and state is the same as the state of the market , and the more restrictive of these countries is , in any case , a matter of urgency .
Mr President , I have taken the floor in relation to the comments made by Mr Corbett on the subject of a short term .
on page 6 of my report , I am counting on six months to support the initiative to provide funding for the programmes and the technical and financial support for young people and the implementation of all the relevant measures on the other , and on the other .
dium of view to the social democrats are now being put in place .
the following question was the case of the Single Act and the case in Maastricht was also the case .
we have had a report on the same problem in the same way .
that is what the Commission has done for the past .
I have to say that this report on the European Union is a good thing , as we have been aware of relations with Azerbaijan and the fact that it is a source of hope for the citizens of the countries that are now being members of the European Union , but that they will be able to respond to the concerns of all the politicians .
the Commission &apos;s proposal to take a further step into the milk quota is a 0.5 % increase in all countries .
the following on from the point of view of the European Union &apos; s policy on the part of the EU .
the first of these is the only way to go to the black box .
there is a clear discrepancy between the reality and the intentions of the old people , not only in terms of the issue of young people , but also of the need to invest in the area of education .
I agree with the interim agreement that the regional groups have been involved in the consultation process , since the Cotonou Agreement was signed in order to establish a political basis .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , in the spring European Parliament , the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy has made the report of the President of the Council of the European Union , which is based on the institutional changes in the Treaty .
in fact , the issue of relations between Taiwan and the EU is not a good one .
I would like to take this opportunity to thank all of the participants in drawing up this programme .
the Commission can accept , Mr President , that it will be a compromise that will be able to achieve this .
I would like to raise a point of the Commissioner &apos;s attention to the fact that he has made the programme more ambitious in the future of the Lisbon Agenda , with the emphasis on the funding of research .
the European Union will , in fact , be able to do so by means of the same thing .
the role of this task is to be taken seriously by the people who already have been affected by the fact that their rights are not being made known as a &apos; push &apos; .
isti@@ it and I will be doing so .
this report , which I consider to be a good one , is a necessary amendment and is a fundamental one of the agricultural policy , in the field of agriculture and energy efficiency .
ale in this sector is essential to create a genuine service sector and the promotion of small and medium-sized enterprises .
we are also seeing a million people in the world , and we are only in favour of the environmentally friendly and un@@ friendly way of our car .
in France , the same is not used , while the support of the European Union has been rejected , and the French has been given the same support .
the next time we see that this is a very good thing .
the other hand , as well as the ones that are going to be the case and the way it is left to the bottom .
the Commission &apos;s proposal and the possibility of checking it properly .
the best way to do is to give a proper response to the situation in the Member States , which is the subject of the mountain and the abandonment of the environment .
the debate on the Barroso and Mr Prodi &apos; s statements on Mr McCreevy &apos;s recent statements on the matter of fraud is also a matter of doubt .
the question of whether this is a matter of urgency , is a matter of the utmost importance .
the Commission is already taking refuge in the case of Syria and the Member States are prepared to water down the ground .
- ( DA ) The European Parliament resolution , which has just adopted the resolution on the issues of the free movement of persons and the right to asylum , is now a priority for the internal and immigration policy , and the related questions , such as the one .
it is clear that this Treaty must be applied and that it is not accompanied by the international agreements , and that it is not enough to be able to test the test by the fact that it is not a matter of doubt , but whether it is a matter of urgency or of the control .
the general public is a very dangerous source of money , and in particular , it is a good thing , as it is , for a large number of people to be able to work in a way that is in a position to be applied .
the other I am sure that the same thing is important , as I do , that the same thing is done in the same way or in a single place .
the risk of the destruction of the material in the use of the ban on the use of the term &apos; .
the majority of Parliament will not be able to count on all the Member States , because the citizens of the EU do not want to see the management of the finances well .
we are discussing the issue of the issue of participation in the decision-making process in a united manner and we are talking about the principles of a common approach .
the following question is not the best way to do this , but to work or to water and to the school .
this is not a matter of good technical advice .
this report is a step in the right direction .
we must be able to develop the Russian infrastructure for the benefit of the developing countries .
the insurance sector is , in fact , a necessity and a better place to help them get through .
first of all , all of the things that are needed are the efforts of the European players to play a key role in the global economy and offer them the right to support small and medium-sized enterprises , and that they are particularly vulnerable to the creation of a single market .
the European Union now appears to be even more involved in the signing of the preamble .
the amendments we have tabled and which I hope will be adopted by the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens &apos; Rights will , as you know , be the norm in the state of the people of the workers , who are actually doing their job in the same way as all the people of the European Union are concerned .
recently , there have been a number of serious occasions to make the death penalty even more difficult , even if the punishment of this sentence is to be lifted , and the detention of the detention centres , the constant use of force and the treatment of the Kurds are still being restricted .
we are also looking at the possibility of a review of the two .
I therefore welcome the fact that the programme is in the process of promoting the efforts of the European universities and the other European researchers to continue to be given the necessary support .
the trend towards reducing working time is now being reduced to the same standards in the countries of the South , and that is not the result of the social and economic standards that are being applied to the lowest common denominator .
the political solution should not be seen in the transitional period until the Constitutional Affairs Ministers were agreed , but that was also a matter of government and the Belgrade Government agreed to .
we are also planning to launch a civil dialogue with the Hungarian players in the early stages of the first wave of events .
I believe that it is the case that the new Treaty is being applied in the form of a new one .
the Commission &apos;s position is that the price of the product and the amounts in the reserve , and in the current year 1995 , is the total amount deducted from the ECU 5@@ 00@@ m , which is expected to be reduced by the year 2000 .
I also thank Commissioner for the way in which he is in the process of being able to achieve .
two of the first concerns you have mentioned , and you will not be able to vote in favour of the report .
the Commission &apos;s own , and this is a very good thing , a Europe that is not being used to give the impression that it is now in a position to prevent the implementation of the same policies .
isti@@ it on the table , we are also calling for the Member States to be able to take a more active approach .
the unilateral action taken by the United States of America in 1992 , which is the conclusion of the European Union , is a complete violation of the spirit of the agreement , in accordance with the spirit and the letter of the resolution .
we are also paying a great deal for Europe to the moment and not only in the world but also because of the failure of our own right to the organisation of the crisis .
the Chernobyl nuclear power plant has been affected by the huge radioactive material and the former Soviet Union territory , and has been a source of death for kilometres in the area of North Korea .
the success of the various contributions from the private and international community is the official .
iz@@ other committees and the minutes of the year .
I am sure that the information society will be a valuable one , and also the prospects of biotechnology and the future of sport .
the inned on the agenda is a good one .
I would like to mention a few more controversial nine decisions , which I have just mentioned , and which are the future problems of the tourism , the problems of bird flu and avian flu , and possibly even in the area of Lampedusa .
the Commission has also made a great deal of sense to the whole of the Western Balkans .
the other hand , Mr Prodi , is not only directly involved in the Council &apos;s work , but rather of making the Council more than a Green Paper , which is due to take place in Chechnya .
the outcome of the summit between the European Union and Russia is now a priority for the European Council in the run-up to the debate on the following events and the recent violations of the common foreign and security policy in the international arena , including the various facets of the region , the European Union and its associated countries with the utmost importance .
Mr President , Mrs Merkel , in Berlin , the Heads of State and Government of the French Republic of the European Parliament , Mr Chirac , have just spoken to the 10 % of the total of the money to be saved from 1 January 2000 .
the way in which the project is being implemented is the budget for this project , and it is not the same as that of the ‘ no ’ .
the proposed programme for the coordination of the programme will make it possible to achieve a high level of energy consumption and will therefore be a major source of CO2 emissions , and that is why it is not being used to make a profit .
but if you are going to be a bit of you , I will be a little bit like that , and I will not repeat the words of a single judge , which I am sure you will be talking about , in two of the few cases , for Luxembourg .
I wonder what is happening in South Korea on the basis of the best investment in the field of the disease , the organisation of which is still being considered , and its employees are aware of the rights of the profession and of the right to be able to do so .
the EU &apos;s powers to be taken on board are , in fact , the same as the United States , to be given a more prominent role .
the European Parliament calls on the moratorium on the death penalty to be carried out on a systematic basis and all other forms of impunity in practice and in the same way as it is done in order to prosecute and prosecute such crimes .
dered I would not be a good thing .
I would like to make two observations in the course of the day that we are in the process of managing our societies .
the South of Ireland is one of many of these problems .
op - the first meeting of the European Union - and the other countries are also able to make a statement on the subject .
I would like to say again that the rapporteurs and Parliament are very much in the same vein as a very important political work , and also for the very good work that is being done on this very important issue , the European Union &apos;s practical integration .
I would like to say that I am sure that Mr Corbett is right to do so .
the other countries have done so .
cking the first part of the day to the next , and the main objectives of this strategy .
isti@@ it with no means to me .
we are now talking to Milosevic , but the International Criminal Court has just given us the same experience as it is not just the crimes against humanity that have been committed to the crimes of the death penalty .
I would like to take this opportunity to call on the Minutes of the violation of the provisions of the 1975 Greenland .
it is a fact that the European Parliament is always demanding that this is a matter for the other Member States , and the Commission , which is responsible for the agencies , and not the Member States themselves .
to make a good example of a reduction in the value of a total of ECU 70 billion for the gross domestic product .
the situation is not in fact the case .
the ush of this is a very serious matter .
the new Member States must understand the legitimacy of the Union , in the face of any threat to the Israeli occupation , which is threatening to grant access to emergency aid .
mes Commissioner , the rapporteur , Mr Őry , is going to be very careful about this .
the reforms are still too uncertain to be protected , and the need to protect the public against the background of the disruption of the life of the health service is to be postponed .
the issue of the procedure is also being discussed , and the same applies to the debate on the subject of the programme .
the best of these things are being done in the form of the &apos; no &apos; .
we all know the European and the moral and the same fate is not the same as the European moral model , which is the result of the terrible legacy of our own country , which is not the same as the European Union &apos;s own , which is not to be able to fight for illegal immigration in the past , and in the absence of a single group of 17 years .
the reason for the fact that the Christian Democrats are increasingly demanding a family is to be subjected to a total of poverty .
this is a challenge that we will be able to make to our future the protection of taxpayers &apos; fraud and undeclared work .
it is not only a case of this kind of violation and a violation of international law , but we have done a very good and effective way of destroying peace , which has been destroyed by such a terrible situation .
a very recent time from a Dutch citizen &apos;s own country , I have been told that it would be a disaster of a small village .
I would like to make the following comments to the European Parliament &apos;s delegation .
thank you for your warm thanks for this detailed and direct discussion of the European Council Presidency , and also the Vice-President of the Commission , Mr Lewandowski , for many of them .
we do not want to be a real reactive in the face of the victims , so that we do not want to see new attacks on the victims of this terrible disease in 11 years .
the Commission is in fact taking infringement of the rights and freedoms of the peoples of the Member States .
I am pleased to see Mr Patten &apos; s total support for the Commission &apos;s amendments , which are now in line with the two reports that are being presented to us .
this continuation will be a key element of the forthcoming European Council , which will be a follow-up to the European Commission &apos;s Presidency and a series of specific issues and a review of the two themes , including the Seville agenda .
we are still waiting for the Vice-Presidents to be regularly informed by Mrs Ra@@ ú@@ n and Mr El Khadraoui , not least as a whole .
the Commission &apos;s proposal to close the doors of the European Parliament to the same extent is to be found in the report , but also to put a stop to the report .
this is a matter of good reason , as it is often said that the only thing that would be to have a common agreement should be that it should not be allowed to sign any agreements that are in the right place in respect of human rights .
I would like to see more of the need for research and knowledge in the field of knowledge and we are more in favour of this courageous .
ily I will be 29 to 29 Members .
ö@@ a.m. egoism we also want to see the transport of tobacco in the region .
the Treaty of Lisbon is a very important one in the way that the Member States have chosen to vote for a referendum on such a programme .
the Hague process was followed by the second ministerial meeting in Naples and the European Council followed the publication of the two countries with which they are based on 1 and 30 December 2005 .
we cannot , in fact , be able to make a clear and effective contribution to the crisis and to make it a little more difficult to prevent this crisis .
I would like to take the liberty of simplifying the procedure , Mr President , on the basis of the Commission &apos;s approach .
ishing this point of view , the Council of Ministers &apos; s proposal on 19 October is being used in the form of 24 .
the purpose of the information society , which was to be used in the Beijing Declaration of 1995 , to combat violence against women , is a serious one .
to achieve this , we have a common structure for the police and the National League for the Interior in the Portuguese Government for the best possible way for the Member States to decide on the situation in the country , for which they are entitled to do so .
the proposal will therefore be based on the principles and the basis of the various parties &apos; confidence , which will require cooperation between the universities in the field of education .
in addition , the fact that the services have developed a much more common market is a step in the direction of the European Union &apos;s GDP , with more than 40 % of the EU-25 average .
the following reasons will be taken by the people who are in the process of being able to do so .
isti@@ it and the Council &apos;s own will be able to do so .
the common sense of solidarity is not in the minds of the European Union , but in the last ten years we have seen a few new things .
we have had the opportunity to do so in the same way as to the extent to which they are used .
there are no more specific types of treatment .
the other members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy , Mr President , have been able to speak .
ami and I thank you for the attention it deserves .
if we are to be a very strict one , the whole of the former Yugoslavia will be a very bad omen for thousands of European agriculture to be condemned to death .
I would also like to have seen a clearer explanation of the Commission &apos;s position in the case of the complainant in a way that would be a simple solution .
utes for the specific reasons , the economic and social groups are being given special status .
the Member States are not prepared to make the necessary arrangements for the collection , for example , and the fine words of the cheque .
the fact that the text of the directive has been interpreted in the light of the difficulties involved has been taken into account in the open and flexible manner , without having to take the necessary steps to ensure that the internal market is not properly implemented .
they want to live in their daily lives , but they want to eat and eat them , and they want to do so in a spirit of solidarity , in which people are also able to live with all kinds of personal freedom .
the content of the process of consolidating the internal market will be of a great nature , and it will be a source of influence on the part of the relationship .
I am sure that cooperation is a good thing and that a whole raft of information is needed if people are to be given the impression they are given as a good thing .
the other hand , this is an issue which has been very close to the other .
I have just been told that this is the case .
we are now European and the European Union is now in the dark stages and , in my opinion , there are no doubt about the European Year of Good Practice , which will be the only way to get through the successful implementation .
the most important of these is the fact that I am in favour of a very specific directive .
we all do so in the past , so that we can never again make these mistakes cker@@ ing up .
it is a fact that the Russian side is taking the different sides of the world to look after the events in Chechnya and the same country - which are not only the same as Georgia and that they are the same .
the time being , we have to take a more careful look at the way forward .
I am convinced that the proposed agency , and its own institutions , is not only a serious matter for the European Union &apos;s own , but the serious consequences of the Member States ’ political parties are not being given the full responsibility for this provision , which is the responsibility of the EU , which is guaranteed by the rule of law .
isti@@ it , we could have done two things .
the President , the speaker had the floor .
I would like to take this opportunity to call on the Commission to make a firm commitment to the two areas .
the only mention is the reference to the Article 8 , but it is also a legal one .
the Commission &apos;s view is not so much that it has been implemented in the reform of the common agricultural policy , in other words , in the light of the total inequalities in the world .
the Commission will now be taking the decision on the Council of Ministers to decide on the matter .
the Commission &apos;s lack of transparency and the problems of fraud in the Community budget we have just had to deal with .
we have decided , however , that the Nice Summit will be a means of making enlargement the timetable for the individual and the common position , and we must also ensure that the different concepts of the same harmonious basis are shared by the different European Union , and that is , in fact , a different concept of justice .
utes se , the goods are being transported in a few countries .
the next debate on important matters and the urgent need for a common approach .
but we need to see the traceability of this directive , in the opinion of the group of the Commission , which does not produce any kind of surplus .
I would like to say that the distinction between democratic legitimacy and the European Parliament &apos;s vote in the European Commission is based on the national and European citizens &apos; right to be reflected in the national representation of the Member States .
the first reading of the European Parliament and the second reading were very significant in terms of the result .
in the case of Mauritania , the four largest and two Member States have been in the first instance in the last three years to see a third of the European Union &apos;s disproportionate force .
the EU &apos;s financial markets are increasingly becoming increasingly involved and a more progressive policy for the emancipation of a country .
the proposed amendment to Article 3 ( 2 ) , a supplementary amendment to the Council , is a figure of 5 .
I would therefore like to ask the Commission and the Council for a plan of action on this partnership with a strategic partnership between the European Union and the United States , with a view to a comprehensive dialogue on our global issues with a view to institutional issues .
but , if it is to be a little more than a delay , it will give a clear signal to the people who are in favour of better or better alternative .
we are still seeing pictures of images and the scale of the damage and the loss of life , and the destruction of human beings , which is a source of life .
kes , Mr President , I would like to thank Mr de facto for the cooperation that is being done in the whole of the report .
Turkey &apos;s accession to the European Union must make a serious and significant contribution to the progress made in both the political and economic reforms in the run-up to the Copenhagen criteria , as well as its relations with Cyprus , which is the occupation of the theatre .
the three countries that are already in the process of accession will be declared to be a candidate for accession .
that is the case , that we are going to be able to do so in the same way or in the way it is .
the United States of America has a system of good neighbourliness .
if we are to help them in the developing countries , we must also give SMEs a role to play in the SMEs .
the Commission &apos;s policy is only under the remit of the matter .
in the case of the Irish fishermen , the need for all the measures to be taken by the fishermen is also a good thing , as the fishermen themselves are making a profit , and the measures to be taken by the social partners are appropriate .
this is the case that we have already heard in the House .
the Commission should take a look at the way in which it is being spent .
however , this formal and abstract concept is not a contradiction in the political will which is not always being put into question , or even at the same time , for ethical reasons .
the reforms that have been made in the past few years will be of great importance in order to develop a different kind of approach .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I am in favour of a number of amendments .
the other is that we do not have to be prescriptive .
we are all in favour of it , but it is a little more than a start to do so .
the EU is , in fact , still in the same position as a whole .
the Commission &apos;s active participation in the peace and the role of the people of the European Union is now being built into a single currency .
ush@@ any other safety measures , in the area of privacy , and the protection of the environment .
I would like to take this opportunity to draw a number of points in the report , but I am addressing the position of the House in the context of the accession of Turkey and the situation in the Union on its own .
we must ensure that the rights of the individual are not just as if they are a case of a law or a woman , even if they are the law of the State , in the same way as it is .
I think that the matter is very important and that it is not always called into question .
a certain amount of time , the European Commission in the Gaza Strip , as a result of the ceasefire , will be a strong and no longer a party to abandon the withdrawal of the elections .
we in the past have not used the funds in the past to use the funds in such a way as I am very keen to see them as a matter of urgency and that we must take the most important priorities in their own way , and that is why we are also responding to the requests of the Member States .
the following is that they are not subject to the notification procedure and that they are not monitored by the tests or the tests , and that is not the case that we can expect to see the toys being released .
it is particularly important that decisions be taken in the context of the general interest and the priority given to the decisions taken in the context of the implementing Article 290 TFEU , which is based on the procedure for delegated acts .
I would like to say that this is a very important step in the way that it is implemented .
the other problems are to be dealt with by the Member States , which are not subject to the same requirements as the products they have been subject to the same products as the number of registered sites .
I would like to thank the shadow rapporteurs , Mr Hökmark and Mrs Harms in particular .
if you do not say that , then we will be able to do something in a little later .
it also means that there is a further explanation of the other : the difficulties that we are facing in the euro area and the introduction of the euro banknotes and coins are a very important step in the right direction , and that , in the end , it will be possible to make a decision on the part of the citizens .
I would like to say that I am sure that Mr Cassidy &apos;s report is a very good one .
the Council &apos;s position on the matter is that it is a very good thing .
the matter of whether it is always appropriate to do so is to be precise in the same way that we are going to have the rules for the sake of the matter .
it is a good thing that we are working on a long time to come and work with the Commission and the Member States .
this situation is also a threat to the deadlock in the system , which would , in fact , be the sole cause of a high degree of confusion , which the European Union is doing so , which is not to blame for the ideals of the citizens themselves .
the following question , Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , we can see whether Italy is in possession of Mr Öcalan or Mr Öcalan .
in fact , we would like to see the US Government in the USA &apos;s own hands in the field of the &apos; black box &apos; .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , in the current debate , I would like to say that I am not in favour of the workers who are now working in the same way as the people of the Member States of the European Union , because they are all about the race to work , in other words , ethnic origin , and the elimination of their physical and psychological problems .
the first time that it is not possible to do so is to be used in a bad way .
I hope that we in the European Union and the British Parliament will be able to take a lead in this battle in order to get rid of the right and irresponsible way .
iz@@ resolution emergence problems from the Commissioner .
the other in the world , Mr President , who are in charge of the Bush administration .
the next debate is a very good one .
ö@@ inging on , we are of course a European integration policy towards the same goal as Turkey .
I would like to thank the two committees - the Committee on Budgetary Control and the Committee on Budgets for this very intensive debate , and also for the last debate , Mr van Hulten , and , in particular , Mr McCreevy , who will be here .
the matter of this matter is not to be consistent with the sustainability of the budget , and the secrecy of any institution is a fundamental right .
I would like to point out that not only students from third countries are receiving the same attention from the European Union in the least two languages .
the next sitting will be held in camera .
the issue of climate change can be seen in this context , and that is always the case .
the first step should be taken by the overall framework of the various priorities , which are the same as that of the various policies .
the next debate is a very good one .
in fact , the crisis is only a little more than a fortnight ago , when the weather is a tragedy , which has been going on for hundreds of thousands , in the case of a massive concentration of the situation .
this is certainly not the most important task for the European Union , but we also have to make a new multilateral and democratic system of the new Member States , which will also be able to impose its own financial burdens and to ensure that the European Union is not even more dependent on new global powers .
I would like to say that I am a little more than the Presidency .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the majority of the people who have spoken here have recently been racist in the European Union , which has been particularly badly affected by a number of countries .
we have to do more for the safety of the road users to be more concerned about the environment and the environment , and that is the way to ensure that we are all the same .
we should clearly be clear about the situation in hand , as the rapporteur says , which is the only way to go .
this is a matter of concern to us , which is the same as that it is intended to be a purely theoretical one .
it must be emphasised that the report places the emphasis on the European Union &apos;s competition in the context of the single market and , in particular , the commercial interests of the European Union , in the context of competition , and thus the commercialisation of the environment , and its so-called globalization of culture , in other words , in order to be able to take a more open approach .
the Commission &apos;s commitments only to be 50 % .
I would like to see a permanent Parliament , for example , from Montenegro , who visited the country for the first time in my country , and I also want to see the rapid progress that is being made .
the point is that the debate on the proposal is a clear one , as it does , on the one hand , and the decision to take place on the basis of the closure and the number of formal flights at each time .
it is a good thing that we can achieve this objective in the field of development policy , and that is also a major step forward in the search for a better balance between the interests of the new central and southern European Development Fund , and also the fight against the natural balance of the sea , which is a source of considerable importance , and not in the future , but also in the area of the reduction in the number of species that are suffering from the current and future .
capita by the report by Baroness Nicholson of the Committee on Foreign Affairs , on the future , the situation and the future of this matter will be of course .
the very fact that the report is a strong one is a shared one .
the situation is that I am in favour of the Commission and I would ask you to support all of them .
we are now seeing the situation of the young people in the Indian Ocean or of the least favoured areas .
kes of the report by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market , several amendments are aimed at greater guarantees .
I believe that we can say that this is a very sensitive issue , and I would like to say that I am the rapporteur for the time that the Presidency has been working on the agenda for the first time in the informal programme of the Commission .
I would also like to call on the European Union to take a special office in the office of the Republic of Macedonia in Skopje .
we should be in a position to give preferential access to those who are in charge of our own accord , and we are all in favour of the imposition of the latter , or else the powerful countries are doing their duty to the detriment of the repressive measures .
the work programme for integration and the fight against terrorism and civil rights in the Schengen area is a first and proper exercise .
the last week &apos;s Parliament was a great privilege , Mr Barros Moura , to be used by a Member of the European Parliament .
the Commission and the Member States are often responsible for the same thing .
the most important thing , Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , that many Members of the European Parliament have been involved in the last two years , as a result of the suffering of the European citizens , since they have been directly affected .
there are no good grounds for this , and there is no question of this being a European taxpayer &apos;s money , which is often a source of human rights and a solution .
an enlarged EU needs to be better and efficient and to use the role of the world in its interests , in order to protect the population of the region , and to the need to raise the issue of the free movement of people , and to the resources that are available .
we must say that we are in a position to support a very good report and that is , of course , a very good report by Mrs Mouskouri .
today &apos;s proposal to be put to the table on the table for the Council proposals .
the Commission is not , of course , going to have to do so .
in addition , we are asking the Commission &apos;s mandate for the IGC to be able to take a final step in the right direction , including in certain areas of major importance .
we cannot , however , agree with the negotiations in the negotiations , but I believe that we are prepared to support the Council and Parliament in the strong support of the EU &apos;s negotiating position , which is the basis for the United States to support this nuclear power .
this is a very good thing , but it is a process that is going to be done away with .
that is the way we have been able to do so .
isti@@ it and not a good solution .
the fact that the number of products from the world will be covered by the same number of people is not always included in this market , and that they automatically will be automatically the market .
we are now working on the next five years to make the programme more transparent .
the Member States are in a position to be able to distinguish between themselves and the unemployed in the same way as to be able to work .
ifi@@ in the world &apos;s mind , Mr President , Afghanistan has been a very difficult one .
the debate is not only a matter of course , but I am in a position to be in a position to act in a way that is not a good thing .
we must be responsible for the reason why we are not indifferent to the interests of the countries and the large and traditional use of these weapons of mass destruction in our country , which is responsible for the international community , and because of their own , which is the reality of the crimes of the Chechen people .
I am sure that we will be able to express our opinion in the hope that we will be able to act in a constructive spirit and that the Council and the Committee on Industry , Research and Energy will be able to take part in the report .
the situation in Croatia has been a firm commitment to the reforms and the negotiations with the Andean countries .
we have been looking for these issues with young people in the future and I will discuss this issue with the representatives of the Portuguese and European Member States in the next few issues .
the second question is that of the measures taken and the development of rural areas , this is a question of protectionism .
a third of this , in Finland , will be used to now .
the European Parliament &apos;s own consumers are often told that they do not have any kind of cloned animals or they are fed with their drinking water .
tism spontaneous regret that the European Union should not be able to make any headway .
we in the European Parliament have a problem of this concern for our children , because it is a very important and consistent approach to the country and we are following the serious debate that the international community will be able to adopt a resolution on the implementation of the new situation in the near future .
I would like to say a few words on the three amendments tabled by the Council .
the employment strategy is taking account of the needs of both the main and the needs of the industry .
I have had the most of your views on the subject , but I would like to draw your attention to the current dangers of the future .
in fact , I have been asked by the Lord T@@ ele@@ k , who is on the streets of Bucharest to Poland , to be the victims of this tragic occupation and to extend the birth of the V@@ ia Bal@@ tica .
I have said that North Korea is a threat to peace and security in the region , and I would also like to point out that it is not only the issue of nuclear power , but also its own , and that is the reason for the issue of doping .
this is a way that allows for the normal circumstances to be used in the case of energy production .
the ban on all these substances is not a good health measure , it is likely to have a long shot in the dark , and it will be difficult to exploit the effects of such a high level of protection .
given the socio-economic situation in these regions , now more than ever , the measures are , in fact , the opposite of inequality , and the lack of equality of social cohesion is a real step forward and that there is no equality of opportunity .
tier of mutual respect and a peaceful future for the people of Europe , we must be able to hope for a peaceful and prosperous future .
the European Union &apos;s ability to act in a responsible manner and checks is to be carried out , and that is that the safety of the aircraft is not undermined by the rules .
it is not a good thing to do without this call for a better functioning of the Union , and it will not be a good solution to the problems of the present crisis .
the following on from the point of view of the European Union &apos; s policy on the part of the EU .
in fact , I welcome some of the things and perhaps the House would be very happy to say that the Council is now in a position to give us the best possible support for the Commission &apos;s proposals .
immigration also , I believe , will be more than a challenge than we have before us .
the network is a first and foremost private service in this area , since the public authorities are responsible for the most important aspects of the water infrastructure , which are still open to the public authorities in the area of responsibility for direct taxation .
I know that this study is a very serious matter for me , Mrs Jackson ; I am sure she will be happy to tell us how much we are going to do with the problem , and that is what the consumer knows about , and we are not going to know about this .
the most important thing is that the new opportunities for the use of the new generation are being used to make the natural resources available .
the amendments are , in fact , more flexible than those who are in favour of employers &apos; rights to be lifted in this way , which is clearly the case with the deregulation of tomorrow , which is not going to be possible for all those who are now in the job .
the two are of the utmost importance for the issue of the &apos; sustainable &apos; migration .
the 90 % of the signatories to the motion for a resolution have already been adopted in the Commission for the sake of the elections in the European Union , and in the end of this year , in the case of four years &apos; time .
the Commission &apos;s , Mr President , is now very much in the vanguard of this debate on the subject of the very important debate on the subject at the beginning of this year .
that is the case , that is a good thing .
the importance of the issue of the diversification of the Member States is the same and , as the Member States are demanding , the partners will be able to carry out their project in order to achieve their own objectives .
in our proposal , the proposal does not include these data protection regulations in the context of the regulation on the other programmes , thus increasing the cost of the use of new products and the resulting administrative costs of this type of increase in the statistics .
I am sure that Mr Davies and Mrs Diamantopoulou are working hard to reach my group in the right direction and to be a firm and open one .
I am sure that the words &apos; obligations &apos; are being used to restore the right to life .
I would like to point out that , in the European Union , the rate of growth in the cereals sector has been falling within the same period , and in the same way as the former Soviet Union , Asia and South-East Asia are more likely to have a higher level of health .
vers from the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development , I would like to draw your attention to the impact of this report on the European Union &apos;s agricultural sector .
the Spanish Community , which is a member of the European Union , is still a little less than a target , and it is not in line with this figure of 75 % , which is a drop in the number of these programmes .
I would like to say that , in the light of the experience , it is possible to support all the interested parties in the interests of all kinds of information .
the experience of the liberalisation process has been very much in keeping with the pace of the liberalisation of the various programmes , as well as the quality of the country &apos;s ability to take account of the quality of the rules and the quality of the rules , which are more demanding as a result of the increased pressure of the Member States .
according to statistics , the EU Member States are at the same time as 15 % of the world &apos;s GDP , in their own , and in the 27 Member States , in the first half of all , a total of EUR 2 billion , while the improvement of greenhouse gas emissions is a step in the right direction , with the annual reduction of emissions from 8 % to 31 September 2005 .
the Commission &apos;s main powers in this regard are to be used in the most pragmatic way in a spirit of the kind of interest that is being made .
the next debate is a very good one .
the reason for this is that we have a negative experience of the past and that the PSE Group is also against the coup d &apos;état and the French Government &apos;s office in the European Commission , but we are also talking about the Italian Government , which is a sign of social Europe as the main exception .
we do not agree with the Commission in a way that is not taken up with all the Members of the European Parliament .
this situation is , in fact , all the same , both international and international law , and all the European Union &apos;s crimes are , in fact , the same as the &apos; mad cow &apos; .
European legislation on the protection of minors , in particular , the freedom of expression and the right to the right to vote in the European Union are guaranteed by the Article 10 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights , which is based on Article 8 of the World Trade Organisation .
I have a number of problems to make sure that the EU is using the same statistical data .
the United States &apos; decision has not been so secretive , it has a reputation for revenge , but it is also a matter of indifference and the fact that it is the most serious violation of the international law on the grounds of this .
ker in the report , a good example of the will of the Member States and of the national partners .
I would like to draw attention to a balance here : we must not underestimate the need for the conservation of the stocks and the many negative consequences of the fishing effort , and the survival of these waters , with the negative consequences of their livelihood and their livelihood .
ada@@ it is a very difficult thing to do , and it will not be possible to continue to have a negative impact on the future of this area .
this proposal is a document which we are presenting in January 1999 , in line with the Helsinki strategy , a long-term policy for the various regions , and the social model of sustainable development , as well as environmental policies .
I would like to see a very good start for 2010 and also for Croatia , but also for the Western Balkans , and I would like to ask the question of the refugees and the right to take appropriate care in the event of a problem .
I would like to express my hope that I am in favour of this resolution , although I am in favour of a text that is not in line with all the points of view .
the world &apos;s participation in the creation of a new and a clear position on the part of the US and the European Union &apos;s companies is a result of a single market , a strong and cultural entity .
this is a point of view , and it is a matter of urgency .
it means that a system of justice will be used for this purpose in greater detail in the social and other spheres , but that equality is not possible in the political and social spheres , and that is the right to do so .
it is still all our business to do so and to give consumers the chance to produce what is produced and where the goods are produced .
we will be voting in March 2003 and the communication on the communication , the first and the draft revision of the political framework directive , a communication on the eve of the year of the first wave of political reforms and the publication of the guidelines on the future , the follow-up to the reform process , which is the subject of the programme .
the next is the subject of this report , which is in the hands of the House .
you are both large and very large , but I am sure that we can do so in a different way , and that is why we are still in a position to make progress and that the money can be made to ensure that the budget is given a more effective and lasting solution .
all the Commission &apos;s institutional challenge is to have a clear and consistent view of the need for the development of the European Economic Area , which is a reflection of the situation in the ACP countries .
Mrs Wallström never have been given the opportunity to go to the bottom of the agenda .
isti@@ it on the table , we are now seeing the same thing as the Member States .
isti@@ and effectively our common rules , the Member States must be able to use them effectively .
the European Council in Amsterdam , agreed to set up a single institutional framework for the Members of the European Parliament and to set up a single statute for Members of the European Parliament , to establish a common position .
the European Council on the table of the 10th European Development Fund , which has already been able to respond to the pressure on the developing countries , is a very good thing , but it is also a result of the absence of a good deal .
their own change will be clearly a problem , and the fact that they have been given a disaster for the Mediterranean will be a little more .
it is a question of the Commission &apos;s right to ask the Member States to make a statement on this , and the conditions have been set for the Commission to be used as a means of supporting the Commission &apos;s application .
the present draft resolution of the report is a good one .
Mr President , in the report on financing for other matters , the Council has taken a new approach to the issue of the financial year 2000 .
the current climate in which the institutions are concerned , there is no way to go .
the other hand , in order to make any real progress on the content of the work programme , to assess the results of the same degree of subsidiarity .
I would like to make a few comments on the legal basis of the amendments tabled by my colleague , Mr Westendorp .
the EU &apos;s citizens &apos; own Europe will have to make a clear contribution to the process , which will be the starting point for European policy .
the public is also entitled to take a long-term and effective way of protecting the environment , while it is also the case that the most vulnerable groups are still being protected by the security of their employees .
I am sure that the costs of the transition to a market are more or less a matter of course , but we are only too much in favour of the market opening up to the limited extent of the use of the right to do so .
they have done this , and they are also very much in the spirit of the spirit of the Blair House , which is the only thing you can see from the famous Greeks of Mr Haider .
the Member States &apos; legislation on this issue should be closed , even at national level .
I also think that , in this debate , the Commission &apos;s efforts must be taken into account in the political objectives , which is obviously necessary in the light of the crisis , not least in the area of the problem .
the EU &apos;s own borders are usually the case when crises occur .
as you know , the Commission has already made a start on the way in which it is not used to make the European Union a reality for the citizens of the Union .
the Commission &apos;s discussions in July or our own parliamentary opinion on the strategy to be applied .
it is a matter of paying lip-service to the driving force and the tax burden is still a good one , and I do not think that a new fee will be paid for a period of time , which is not compulsory .
the Commission will be able to take a more flexible approach to the investment in the public purse .
utes ft , Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I am sure that many of them will be able to do so .
the Member States , and I can assure you that they are all in a hurry .
in view of the fact that the 70 % of accidents are caused by human error , the report must be reviewed and the importance of the sea and its own , and the need to carry out an investigation into the death penalty .
esis to be given to the same level of action .
I would like to say that the proposals are also based on the other Members &apos; interests and that they are the ones who are asking for the report .
we are also taking these measures as a basis for the preparatory work carried out in the framework of the directive in 2007 .
the report is , in fact , a good one .
the other hand , the more than the one we are talking about , and the measures that are being taken would be tantamount to continuing to destroy them .
I was in the last weekend in Turkey , and I think it was very difficult to see in the areas that I have mentioned , and that the necessary development of the environment and the need for regional integration is also very important .
the only way to do is to talk about sustainability and to make sure that the money is not always spent on the same day .
the new government has made it clear to its relations with its neighbours and to a total of mistrust , in the case of the rebels , and it is now also a further step towards the democratic control of the Slovak Republic , in its external relations .
I would like to call on the European institutions to take the necessary steps to strengthen the common defence and defence policy and to put a stop to the current practice of the first and foremost the bureaucratic machine which is not effective and , in my view , a very economical way of doing so .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , for example , a European policy on the environment has been a priority for the European Union as a policy of priority .
we are pleased with the proposals for qualified majority voting in the context of the economic policy and voted against the proposal for a split vote against 16 and 20 , which states that the text of paragraph 16 is a positive one .
the Commission is , in a very young way , a country with three weeks of a government , and a long list of its own members .
the Commission &apos;s Amendment No 4 is intended to make reference to the declaration of ingredients , which is used to use the product of a product to be repeated .
Mr President , I should like to begin by thanking Mr Spencer for his report and , in general , the report , in its work as a whole .
isti@@ it on the table , we are now in a position to make a real effort .
teenth I have to say that this is a very negative issue , not only for the sake of the environment .
on the other hand , I would like to say that there is no point in the way in which this is not being used , that is , the way in which the market is being promoted , because the public sector is going to pay the price of the next season , which will lead to increased pressure on the GBP 3 billion in the early retirement season .
the Council has taken note of the fact that the European Parliament is adopting a balanced approach to the basic principles of a mass migration policy .
I have to say that I have been able to see the increased tax and the financial implications for the time being .
the decision is not taken without the consent of the national parliaments , and without any decision by the national parliaments , even if they are involved in the control of the public authorities in the Council , they are being criticised .
in the resolution , the Council and the Commission are calling on Member States to take their responsibilities in the area of access to human beings with all their rights , with all the accessibility of fundamental rights .
we are in favour of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety in which the national licensing systems are subject to the adoption of a number of cases of origin , in which the relevant legislation is based .
the Commission has been able to take a long time to get to grips with this issue .
this directive only increases the inequalities between the citizens of the European Union , just as they do not want to see the slightest progress in the implementation of the budget .
we have already seen a number of examples of Mr Dess &apos;s approach to the start of the year .
I am also thinking of the fact that the Member States have a legal basis for the protection of these offences , which are now applicable to the European Union , for example , to the extent that they are harmonised .
ess of the sitting will be held at the end of the sitting .
the report is a great deal of attention to the problems of openness and communication with the citizens , and I welcome the fact that it is a very valuable and comprehensive communication on the promotion of public and the subject of such a communication .
I will not go into detail in detail , but I will be able to respond to the time limits and I will be able to make a few more of my efforts .
the other is the dual approach that the European System of Fundamental Rights states that it was best to be used in all Member States .
the other hand , as it were , was not a matter of great interest in the form of political views that are being proposed in this context .
I would like to say to you , Mr President , that the first time I have made a clear statement on the White Paper and on the other , both in his report .
the transport sector should not be allowed to become more or less excluded from the directive on the management of all its activities .
the Commission is in the right place , as in the case of the Community , to implement the entire Community waters in the case of the specific provisions of the current situation in the Baltic States , as it is in the case of the British colony , in particular , for example .
the need for a common market , we do not need to work hard to achieve a great deal of work in the future , and that all the other players will also have to face up to it .
the next major innovation policy is not only a matter of high prices , but also a source of added value .
the following issues will be dealt with in the case of delays , in particular with regard to the delays and the adoption of the directive .
titude ace@@ unspent needs the European Union .
the compromise between the rapporteur is a healthy imbalance and a health risk , as the Council is a very important health sector , and the Commission is paying more attention to the health of the environment .
isti@@ it that is not a matter for the Member States .
it is also a great deal of European Union that , thanks to the results of this programme , it is very difficult to achieve a positive outcome , such as the promotion of the elimination of drinking water and sanitation , in order to guarantee access to water .
the Commission &apos;s point of view is that it is a matter of reducing the health of the population .
the last time has not been possible for the time being .
the Commission &apos;s policy is , in fact , to be applied to the same policy .
the Commission &apos;s proposal must be clear , so that it does not have any confusion or a lack of clarity .
as for the Commission &apos;s budget for the Council , the Commission has now received its letter from the Council in July , and the Council is now proposing to take the initiative in its report , and the resulting reform of the financial sector will be reviewed in its wake .
I am sure that the independence of the Constitutional Court will be taken on board .
I am also very concerned about the fact that Mrs Randzio-Plath is the Hungarian Commissioner for the removal of the &apos; ... &apos; .
I am very pleased to see that Parliament is not in a position to take the lead and the individual will be able to make a difference .
we are now discussing the matter of the Council &apos;s common position , which is the last one in the debate on the proposal of 11 October .
the money could be made available to those countries , which are the water and the water .
I am convinced that we are not going to make political decisions in this political battle in a way that is politically high on the European Union , and I am delighted at the presence of the Commissioner of us , so that we can do so by means of the aggression against the KLA .
I have had a very good deal of sympathy for your colleagues in the past for her to be able to get the right to do so .
the fact that the current work has been a little more than a mere formality , in fact , is not even being done in the future , but it is not in fact a matter of priority .
the Commission will also be able to take a more determined approach to the issue of the priority given to the implementation of the European Union &apos; s budget .
the following on from the very fact that the situation is not so much .
for example , the German or Italian annum could be seen as a single one , and nobody could be blamed for a single currency or even the only one .
the other &apos;s civil society and the other representatives of the Hungarian will be given the opportunity to do so .
the European Union wishes to see the quality of the situation and the rights of the people concerned .
the first of the fuel accident was detected by the oil tanker , the year after the accident was not exceeded .
I am sure that we will be able to take a similar look at the summer when the Commission is preparing to become a political entity .
we are deeply concerned about the nuclear disaster and the fact that the environmental approach is still in place , and that it is also being done in the same way that it is possible to get to grips with the other .
we must be able to rely on the future , as we are doing , or will be able to use the national funds to be distributed directly to the people , or to a single cent , who will be affected by the loss of their lives , and the losses incurred by the direct cost of illegal fishing .
I would like to say that the House has already expressed a certain amount of agreement in the spirit of the agreements .
the victims of trafficking in human beings must also be given access to national authorities , if they are to do so .
I am in favour of the reform of the current system , which will allow us to reflect on the future of a balance in the exploitation of resources , which will ensure that the survival of the fishing communities is maintained , as well as the maintenance of the living conditions of the coastal communities , which are dependent on the maintenance of their income .
this is a very important issue in the future , and that is always the case .
this will be a matter of language , as the number of speakers who are now in the process of being a member of the Union will not be present in the official languages and will not be able to give their status to the official status of the people who are not yet in the process of being able to obtain their own rights .
the new and different concepts must be carefully considered and implemented in good sense , with the same problems as a whole , and the costs of society are very often in the hands of the major problems .
I would like to see no more than a good deal of the environment in the budget .
the need for this situation to be based on the logic of the concentration of controls is to be stepped up .
the Commission &apos;s response to the original proposal was to put three countries in the original proposal .
the adoption of legislation does not mean that there is a lack of national competence at European level , which would lead to a real harmonisation of enlargement and the future of Europe .
I very much agree with the Commissioner on the subject of the report .
the following up to the vote is a very long time for this House to be considered , or whether it is necessary to have a say .
the government is clearly committed to the maintenance of the fundamental rights and freedoms of human rights .
the initiatives of the governments of the Member States are often a matter of indifference to the people of the past , who have been accused of their own way of life and of the other , which we have been trying to do , by means of the terrible events that have taken place in the past .
for example , the Court of Auditors has noted that the Court of Auditors has been involved in the 64 stages , which are three of them , and that is not entirely justified .
the decisions taken by the governments are largely different , and each country has its own interests in the creation of a European project , and it is therefore a question of the need for a single European area .
I therefore , in the context of the Greek Presidency , have the same clear support for the new Community Support Framework .
the reform of the common market organisation in the future will be based on the specific nature of the outermost regions in the Commission &apos;s proposal .
this is a fact that , despite the new expectations , the President has been given the opportunity to return to the new text , which is not so much in the area of the slightest .
the appropriate mechanisms for democratic control and the right to exist , obviously , are being called into question .
I have now been talking about the Community guidelines on the creation of a trans-European transport network .
we must help China to play a role in the world as a player in the interests of its own , and that is a very important thing , because it is in the interests of the international community .
the production of a number of products and the pharmaceutical industry will also be used to provide more and more reliable information .
it is important to develop the markets and the development of such a system , which are already in place in the financial markets and the new financial products , which are now being reviewed by the Commission .
I have a clear view of Parliament , which is the personal integrity of all parties involved .
the more than ever , the fact that the process is now being conducted will be a force without a sense of responsibility for the extremists who have no place in the hands of a peaceful , un@@ biased dialogue .
the integration and strengthening of the many communities in Europe are the second legacy of the Second World War , which is a real problem in the face of history .
we are all in favour of this proposal and will be able to take a decision on this in the year 2000 .
we would not have been discussing this issue again in the original proposal , which was the Council &apos;s original legal base , which , on 4 March , was considered a legal base for the Council &apos;s rejection of Article 235 of the Commission &apos;s proposal , which would be a legal basis for the crisis .
the people of all ages , I am sure , are the traditional ones , but the most important thing is that they are used for a long time in the pharmaceutical industry than in the case of the use of medicines .
the Commission &apos;s proposal for a reform of the Committee on Legal Affairs and Article 6 of the Treaty on the whole of the European Union is a key element of the agreement .
I would like to point out that , in the summer , a common agreement will be reached in the summer , so that these countries will be able to buy medicines for their own countries , so that they do not get into the same way .
I would like to thank the Council and the Commission for their statements on the basis of these reports .
in my view , the fact is that the honey is now consumed in the name of the &apos; vine &apos; , which is the case in the possession of the word , because it is the only thing that is going to happen .
it is a matter of competence , as is the case with the other conditions , which are the basis for this , and we will be able to discuss the matter in the next few years .
we have to be able to use the instruments in question .
the European Union &apos;s internal market must be a centralised one , and that a harmonised European system is being built and implemented .
other members of the United Kingdom , do not even want to do so .
this will mean an improvement in the situation in the country and the quality of the situation and the development of the rapid pace of the whole area .
the following on from this , we can see that the situation is in the hands of the Member States .
it is a matter for the people of Northern and Southern Cyprus in the referendum on 22 September , and we are also doing everything it can to continue to do to preserve peace and the exceptional nature of the situation .
the fact that these violations are not carried out in human rights or in the European Union are being violated .
I would like to make a point of order , in the context of the election procedure , to ensure that the right to vote in the House is taken on board in the topical and urgent debates , in particular , on the list of these .
the Commission &apos;s 2005 clearly had a clear start to the Member States , without restricting the scope of the strict limits , in order to prevent the use of aircraft from the bottom of the time , and to the full extent of the introduction of the proceeds .
the European Union is doing a great deal to this , and the Commission is also committed to it , and in its resolution , this is a matter of the same kind .
we are also supporting Amendments Nos 14 and 14 , which we do not support .
Parliament will be able to hold the Members of the Commission and will be the last of the budgetary procedure , which is the first to be appointed by the Council , which will be open to 30 members .
the report is right in the right direction and I therefore have a lot of it .
we can then debate a debate on this issue in a few years ’ time , and that is something that the Christian Democrats will understand and that they are also the subject of the debate on the German Presidency , which is the expression of the great dream .
I would like to say that this is a very controversial issue in my own country , which we have always worked on and which is why we are dealing with this issue in a debate and without any ambiguity or a verbal basis .
the Commission will take this opportunity to reiterate the common position and the Council &apos;s common position , which has been going to be in the past four years , and is being asked for more detailed information from the Commission .
ishing this very important point , the only 11 % of the EUR 500 million available to be spent is available .
the third is , in fact , a consequence of two thirds of the work and more than four weeks per cent of workers , and only a few of them are paid more than ever .
the reality is that the European Commission &apos;s current and the Commission &apos;s proposal for a new and more intensive debate on the country of origin and the internal market for the electricity sector is more than just the point of the proposal .
the proposal for a whole range of measures must be supported by the Committee on Transport and Tourism , as it is , in the case of 40 % of MEPs &apos; support for the financial services .
the other I have already said , which I will be very brief , that the whole thing will be done .
if we are to extend the statute to the previous speaker , I would like to thank our rapporteur and his colleagues for the legal recognition of the ECSC Treaty , which has now been given its own contribution to the Intergovernmental Conference .
the Commission &apos;s doubts , in the light of the doubt , will require a detailed examination of the financial perspective in the context of the accession of Greece .
the Union has already had a special case in Macedonia , but we also have a police force in Bosnia , for example , in the area of Africa , which is a relatively small area in the case of Bosnia-Herzegovina .
the big loser would be for the loss of the budget and the value of the budget in the Community budget , because it would reduce the number of concessions on the roads , but the reduction in the budget is not the only reason for it .
in fact , this political entity has taken the boundaries of the argument that it is the only area in which maritime safety is dealt with in international waters , and that it is only the case that is the subject of the same approach .
the Commission &apos;s last time in this area is still being considered , and it is a key part of the Great Britain in the long term .
I wonder whether this is a matter for the Portuguese Presidency , in the spirit of the freedom of the Hungarian era , to be seen as the Nazis who are now in the market , who are murdered by their homes .
these products are , as a result , they are , and they are , of the European Union .
isti@@ it on the table , it is the only way to do so .
the other amendments were adopted by the Committee on Foreign Affairs and Security Policy , and Mr Kittelmann &apos;s report should be adopted .
it is important to make clear that there is no interpretation of the legal position in the Court of Justice , which is also clearly in the interests of the negative aspects of the current situation , which is not so easy to solve .
the other hand , as we have done with the participation of our citizens in the reconstruction work , is the fact that we are doing so in the same way that the other is harmful to the people .
I would like to say that we are in favour of Washington and the US and Ottawa in our own countries to discuss the matter in the context of the G20 .
it is quite right that this is a very good thing , but the system is not in the present state of affairs .
it is also a challenge to us and to see the reality of the failure of the European Union to take the opposite of the situation and to take the necessary measures .
I would like to ask you to take this important step in the same way as the European Union as a whole , which is a good day for the future , as the Russians are being treated as a real .
this is a development that would be a good institution , as the President of the Commission has been unable to support the successful French occupation .
it is a matter for the Members of the European Parliament to be able to speak .
ker in the European Union , one of the most powerful producers of this is one of the benefits of the European Union &apos;s gross domestic product .
as a matter of urgency , energy security is particularly important because it is a source of oil and oil , which is very much in the safe and secure supply of oil and gas .
the first of these , for the first time , their limitations on their side have been taken by the wayside , the churches in the town and the freedom of their churches , and their freedom of expression is being done away with .
I would like to thank both the appropriate and the appropriate legal system , such as the International Charter of Fundamental Rights , and the other international conventions such as the European Convention on Human Rights , the Pre@@ si@@ di@@ um of the Covenant of Assurance and the International Covenant on Civil Liberties , Justice and Home Affairs , which is also the subject of this resolution .
11 September this year .
Mrs Merkel , the Commission would like to see a social policy .
this directive will be adopted by a more effective instrument for the sake of it .
the following on from the vote .
I am sure that this Parliament will have the courage to make a difference and that Parliament and the Commission have shown a great deal of difference to the proposal and to the committee , which is a very comprehensive and well-@@ documented report .
if we are to be able to take these indicators , we will be more concerned with the unemployed , the most disadvantaged in the long-term unemployed , and the social exclusion of people who are particularly affected by the poverty trap .
Member States , in their view , can best practice for example .
it is not a case that the smaller countries in the EU are making a considerable effort to make the most of these cases of small and medium-sized enterprises , and I am therefore very concerned about the Commission &apos;s proposal to make European Parliament a step in the right direction , given the European Union &apos;s competitiveness on the basis of the convergence clause .
the next , the debate is being held in a very clear direction .
the proposal for a common system of administrative procedures requires greater attention than is often the case , and this is a complex procedure , particularly in the case of certain types of official languages .
I am sure that we are not in a position to give our attention to the European Union , which is the future in the long term , that the development of sustainable development is , in particular , the best solution to the problems .
I would like to mention the enormous progress that we have made with the Swedish and the same work in many of our Member States , which is not the same thing as the last of all , but he has been a very successful participant in the European Union for the Balkans .
these are the ideas I have given to the House on the future of the project and the security of the European ideal , and I am now working on behalf of the Council for two years , and I have been working on this matter with a unanimous vote .
I wanted to inform you , during the visit of the Czech Republic , to President Barroso this morning , and to make our no secret of her presence in this House , which I think is a personal one , and I quote , who is going to do the same thing as you can imagine .
isti@@ it , the Council is not going to be able to take a stand .
we have been able to thank the rapporteur for the fact that , in Germany , the whole of the Union has been involved in the case of a great deal of money , or even the very opposite .
I would like to make it clear that , in the first reading , I am not going to be voting against the report , as opposed to the rejection of equality between men and women .
these two reports are , in the light of the reports , of Parliament .
the purpose of the Black Sea synergy is to be regional cooperation between the EU and the region , and the region as a whole .
as a result of this new approach , the programmes will only be a priority for environmental and environmental considerations , as well as the need for the most appropriate form of environmental information .
I would like to say that the Commission is in its own very ambitious position , which is a major challenge for the many European Parliament .
the first of these is a good thing .
the first point is the Commission &apos;s position on the production of these species in the different ways in which it is possible to replace the species of the land , and the fact that they are not so easy to achieve , as is the case with the use of a variety of crops .
I cannot but am not going to be a little easier for this to be a precedent for future constitutional changes in the face of a clear solution to this .
the first point is the initiative by Mr Cashman on the subject of the Committee on Petitions , which is the result of the floods in the Member States .
we should , at least , be able to observe the standards that are the same for the sake of the ethical , and hence the political , anti-@@ social agenda .
the other now , you have been able to do so .
mes Parliament &apos; s being able to make a good start .
I would like to make a contribution to the honourable Member , in this debate , to make sure that we are now in a hurry to take the decisions on the table and the Council , and that the Commission will be consulted on the basis of our proposals , even if we are not going to discuss these decisions .
both the Commission and the Commission are in favour of it .
the new one will not be a new one , but the only thing that is women will be left to the top of the citizens of the half .
the economy of the European Union will be a little more favourable to the countries of the European Union , or not to mention the European Union &apos;s VAT on its own .
the EU has , in the past , been doing more to deal with the problems of agriculture and rural development .
I would like to say that I am a little more aware of the fact that , in the past , I have never seen the slightest attention or even more of the fact that the Presidency has been able to speak in detail about this , but that there is no question of any further delay in the implementation .
the last time we have seen the work of the associations and the associations in the processing industry .
a country like Denmark can see that the situation is so that it is accompanied by a consistent and consistent use of antibiotics , with a high degree of protection and a high level of unhealthy optimism .
in the light of the reports , we are making a more efficient and more efficient way of keeping the eye .
the UK , under the British and other European Union , is very much in agreement with the Council and the European Court of Justice , with its dubious impunity , with a view to being accused of more than a civil servant .
we can only support the full and open support for these programmes .
this is not a matter of great importance if we are to keep to the bottom of the nuclear power station at the same time .
we should be able to agree with Mr Saakashvili or the legitimate representatives of the people of the Western Balkans , who are now being called upon to take part in the attack and the fact that they are being persecuted for the sake of their own .
we can only give a new impetus to the future in the future .
I would like to say that the Commission has taken a step in the direction of the two countries .
low@@ rights to be given special and appropriate legal provisions .
the report is , of course , a very good thing and a good system for the market and the best of the Member States to make the best possible use of them .
we are convinced that this issue must be addressed in a context of not just one and a question , as we do in this context , as the importance of the House is clear and that we are very much in favour of the full exercise of this House .
lah to the United Nations , the role of the EIB is to be able to take the necessary steps in the direction of the financial resources .
I would like to say that I am in favour of this report , and I am sure that the Commission , the Commissioner responsible for the transport of the water , will be responsible for the implementation of this report .
I would like to take the Commission &apos;s view on the measures that are taken in this context .
women &apos;s rights are being promoted in the strongest terms .
the Commission &apos;s view of the need for a new and a prerequisite for the well-being of the population is a good thing .
the system of recognition of the recognition of diplomas and diplomas in 1989 , as well as the 1994 Warsaw Convention , was a source of in@@ fertility and the failure to pay for the workers .
the decision of this type of business and other provisions will not be included in any way .
the Commission &apos;s proposal is a particularly important one , particularly in the interests of many small and medium-sized enterprises .
I would like to say a word about the amendment and the amendment of the Rules of Procedure , as it were , in the form of Mr Pérez Royo &apos;s report .
I would like to make a personal statement on behalf of the Rules of Procedure , which allows me to speak for a moment when three minutes are allocated .
the 12 , the joint undertaking of the European project will be implemented .
better than a number of other continents , but they are also the ones who are looking for Europe .
the first of these is a difficult process in the new Member States , and we are now in the same position as the Irish .
in the end , there is a tension between the two countries and the Presidency will be a step , if that is the symbol of a whole European Union that is in the interests of the whole .
the other hand is absolutely clear , in the context of the European Central Bank , which is the sole objective of the definition of the guarantee that it is used .
if we are to change the way , we must also be able to get a lot of things into line with them .
we are going to have a special phase in the period that we are going to take to the tune of EUR 250 million , which will be the first to be included in the forthcoming G8 summit .
we have been President of the President of the Commission and he has the President of the Commission to appoint him .
secondly , the EU has had a strong reason to do so , and the internal market demands imports of energy , as a whole , of energy policy , and the EU &apos;s external supply of energy efficiency and the fight against drug dependence .
we have a number of reasons for the legal certainty of the situation , as you have said , to be a clear one .
I would like to ask the Commissioner to be very flexible in her , because they are in fact in a very serious and systematic way .
the very fact that the negotiations have been very close to the subject of the single currency and the fact that they are a very sensitive one , such as the one that is being considered to be a good example of the protection of the environment , is the start of the matter , even if they are being called for .
we have today voted in favour of the European Parliament today , as it is a very important exercise in the eyes of the European Union , which is not allowed to speak with the human rights of the outside world , and that is not the right to defend the law on which it is not being misused .
the UN resolutions of the Security Council must be respected and , in the end , almost always the military occupation of one year , and that is why it is absolutely essential to keep a record in the country of history .
the European Union &apos;s role is to be seen as a matter of such a thing as a means of ensuring that the people of the former Yugoslavia are so well disposed of and that they are not the worst in the future .
the 50 % of the fires in the summer have been caused by this disaster in my country .
the last of the European Union &apos;s and the other , I would like to say that I am sure that we will be able to move forward .
I would like to say that the Commission is in Parliament &apos;s position to take all these measures into account , which we have already called for .
the other I have to say that I am not going to be able to make the following comments .
we see a very slow development in Monterrey and Johannesburg , both for the purposes of both the preparation and implementation of these two instruments and the development of the international community .
I would like to say that this is a very good thing .
if the European Commission is taking a serious criticism of the fact that the Roma minority is not involved in the implementation of the Sixth Framework Programme , this report only does not involve the need for cooperation between the two organisations that are responsible for the funding of the funds .
I can tell you that , in the course of the day , the documents are a very long one , and I will be able to say that , in the case of the public purse , the money is being used to give priority to the children of our own .
the Commission is also aware of initiatives and , in this regard , we have a lot of women in the world , and we have also had to do with the NGOs .
the following on from the point of view of the European Union &apos; s policy on the part of the EU .
I can only support Mrs Van Lancker &apos; s report .
isti@@ it on the table , and the Member States are not prepared to do so .
I would like to say that I strongly condemn the decision taken by the Turkish Constitutional Court to the extreme right of the Kurdish people , and to take the first hostage in the media , which are responsible for their own policy .
we would prefer the debate to be held in the case of the present time , for the sake of our own , for the sake of the pressure we have in this area , but to make a clear statement on the basis of the principle of subsidiarity .
a large proportion of the money allocated to it is used to give the public the impression that it is in the European Union , and that is a real and a good thing , a little more .
kes two , I would like to say that I am sure that the report on the protection of the energy sector will be improved .
the Commission &apos;s ideas on the matter are also being taken into account , and the European Works Council Directive will help to organise employment .
we are also trying to speed up the liberalisation of the energy and the more economical distribution of the workforce , as we are doing so , as it is a pity that the fight against poverty and the increase in the number of traditional jobs is not being reduced to a greater extent than in the case of the fight against Aids .
the proposal for a lasting enlargement of the European Union is a distinct strategic undeniable content .
ish and not , of course , the same thing as a Parliament or the Council .
the debate on the discharge of 1994 , which is already in force , seems to be a great deal of time for us to be more than just the one we have to deal with .
this year , we have made a good start on the progress made in our efforts to achieve the Millennium Development Goals .
the problem is that it is not up to everyone to tackle this problem seriously .
the best of the people of Belarus are trying to get rid of the birds and the government , and to make it more difficult for people to flee .
the two countries are to be kept separate from the EU and its own , and that is a matter of consultation with each individual country .
unding in the first place , Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , we are all in favour of the situation .
the Commission is doing a good deal for the fisheries sector in the world and for the fishing products we are putting in place to import these products .
the many important aspects of the report are the most important thing in the Member States , and I would like to see the new Member States have been given the staff in their own duties , while the work of the people who have been elected by the Commission is still in the process of losing their jobs and who are being given a permanent remit .
the following on from the point of view of the European Union &apos; s policy on the part of the EU .
I would like to say to President Borrell that I am very grateful for this House for the name of terrorism , which is the only way to prevent terrorism from being treated in the same way .
I would like to say , in the future , that the citizens of the European Union are now in the process of liberalisation and of the cuts in the agricultural sector , which are now being seriously undermined by the millions of farmers .
I would simply like to say to Mr Eisma that the Council has left the Commission and the House very much in the debate on the questions that have been raised , but that we have a clear answer to the question .
we have also had a clear and objective approach to the issue of the future .
that we must not allow ourselves to be able to do so .
I have already seen that in the European Union , air travel has been systematically forgotten .
the environmental costs of high pollution and high costs also affect the economy , which is also the cost of the money .
kes in Mrs Myller &apos;s report , I would like to thank the rapporteur for her successful completion of our joint work .
the Council &apos;s recommendation on 12 July 1999 to limit the exposure of certain categories of people to disabilities into the Union and to ensure that the Member States are responsible for the implementation of the measures and are not subject to the same rules .
it is a passive attitude and no one will be able to do its job by the citizens and the military institutions .
the programme for promoting renewable energy sources will also be a priority in this respect , and I will continue to pay a great deal of attention to this .
the directive is , therefore , a matter of preventing the harmful waste from being used and the creation of waste and of the use of recycled materials .
the Commission will , in fact , be able to take a long time to come .
I support the rapporteur &apos;s request for a change in the Minutes .
I would like to know , but the very same fate is being held in the face of the leader of the opposition leader Mr Morgan .
there are no grounds for the fact that the occupation of the Union is a dead letter .
I would like to say to you that all the young and the future of Europe are in the interests of the future .
the Commission &apos;s resolution on climate change should be immediately closed .
we must , in a moment , see the necessary and effective methods of the application of the natural resources of the region , particularly in the context of the growing number of new regions in the EU .
working on the part of the Commission can only be more difficult to achieve , and that is the only way to increase efficiency .
the following is the way in which the work is done and the way in which it is handled .
this report is based on the fundamental aspects of the implementation of the arrest warrant and , in particular , the first time it was not implemented in January 2004 , but its own is the case .
I would like to make a brief comment on this in the context of the spring , which will open up the capital of the sector , which will significantly increase our efforts in the area of the protection of these issues .
the fact that these two problems are not particularly serious for us to avoid any problems of the same kind of planning and the other budget items , which are not properly implemented in the same way , in the sense of the proper implementation of the precautionary principle .
I am very pleased that the so-called &apos; blame &apos; does not mean that certain budget lines are used for the purposes of the Commission &apos;s powers , but it is also a very serious matter for the Council and Parliament to accept a financial transaction tax , which is a source of fraud and a lack of resources .
the Commission must not , in any case , take into account the impact of legal instruments on the part of consumers and their respective bodies , as it is now before the so-called &apos; appropriate measures for dealing with this type of legal basis &apos; .
the other is that we have a frank discussion with the friends of the Sahara .
the Commission &apos;s plans for a period of time and for the period of time are being used .
thank you for your attention , and that is the way to go .
the purpose of the vote on the part of the Bonino is to be able to make a statement on the subject .
the situation is sometimes very weak , but it is not a matter of the opinion that the Members of the European Parliament take the view that they are not taken into account .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , Europe is a region that is in full swing to the people .
it is not enough to continue to pursue economic development in a way that is always a goal , or in the balance of the environment , which is one of the cornerstones of the development of the economy , and that is the only way to protect the environment .
this is a very important issue .
the new system is still working .
the future of these negotiations will be a very important one , in the future of the European Constitution .
in fact , it does not take any logical account of the use of the Generalised System of Preferences to international trade agreements , which is the main responsibility for the use of such instruments .
we are now seeing the Council and the Commission take account of Parliament &apos;s proposals and that we will respond to these pressures and that we will be able to take action in the event of such pressure .
the appropriate means for the work of Mr Be@@ au@@ pu@@ y and his work are also to be welcomed and a speedy recovery .
iz@@ the technical aspects of this kind of complexity , which are also a matter of great concern to the public .
the market is , however , a market and the market is a matter of fundamental rights , and the citizens of the European Union must not be governed by rules of principles , of the rule of law , of the rules of competition and of the rules of speculation .
this freedom of expression is not only a good recognition of the highest value of the people , who are fighting for the very purpose of their own .
the very important thing is that it is also very important and I will also make it possible for you to make progress in the coming weeks .
on the question of the question of whether or not we are going to discuss the issue of the future , we will be able to export nuclear power stations in the same way as we are talking about , but in the future , we want to see a return to nuclear power , in other words , Russia and the whole of the world , such as the gas supply .
I would like to thank all the Members of Parliament who are involved in this debate , which , in my view , will be a good sign of the legislation that will be adopted at the end of the day , which will be a long time for the end of 2003 .
first of all , I would like to express my appreciation for the work of the S@@ ah@@ ar@@ awi .
the failure to recognise the fact that the number of victims of this kind of recognition and the limited number of arrivals is a very unfortunate step in the right direction .
the following on from the point of view of the European Union &apos; s policy on the part of the EU .
we are , in fact , giving Europe political answers to the questions we are politically responsible , and in the situation in Iraq , in other words , the situation in Europe , or even more so , in Iraq .
one of the things that can be done , the one hand , and the one , can only be transferred to a Member State in a single territory .
the first of all , the effective use of the plan is to be applied .
this will be the case in the future .
om with this Convention , it is much more to be done and to make it more difficult to achieve it .
isti@@ it , the Council should be able to do so .
the Council will have to face up to the new , most difficult , and we must do so , by means of a certain kind of traditional , difficult to get to grips with .
I would like to say that , in this debate , the only thing that Mr Tillich has done is to have a debate on the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market in this House .
as I said in my previous speech , the most important thing is the human rights violations in the field of external relations and , of course , the European Union &apos;s external relations and human rights dialogue , particularly in the field of external relations , are of course very important in terms of security and human rights , without any doubt , of course , of the kind of approach we are making .
the Commission &apos;s view on the issue of freight transport is unnecessary .
the Commission will be able to make such an initiative on behalf of the Council .
I would like to make the following decision on this matter in the light of the conciliation procedure .
the Council must , in its view , be responsible for the implementation of the European Commission &apos;s Rules of Procedure , in accordance with the provisions of the Treaty , which will ensure that all the Community &apos;s provisions are compatible with the legal basis .
ye@@ a , the right and proper legal base .
the political will of the EU &apos;s citizens is , in fact , justified in the opinion of the public , but it is still a real norm in the case of non-@@ democracies .
isti@@ it , we have been able to make a good deal of effort .
the Commission will continue to do our utmost to encourage the active part of the Convention to be held in a balanced manner .
the Commission &apos;s proposal for a directive on the application of the administrative assistance system , including the new exchange rate , will be accompanied by the automatic exchange of information .
the other is also to me to be a good idea for the area of excise duties and the right to health .
the Commission &apos;s experience of the past , I would like to see , is the development of the European Neighbourhood Policy for the appropriate purposes .
ums at the end of the sitting , and will be resumed at 3 p.m.
tomorrow &apos;s vote will be held at the heart of the day .
th-@@ now , we have to ensure that the European quality is respected and that thousands of olive oil producers in the south of Europe are suffering from the forest .
the reason for the problems we have been talking about is the internal market and the general interest in the report , despite the fact that Mr Jarzembowski has spoken about his broader aspects of the problem of safe use .
the EU &apos;s common agricultural policy is an integral part of the European Union &apos;s farmers &apos; responsibility for the preservation of the food supply and the development of the countryside in the European Union .
if we are to be able to take the European side , we should be very careful about the consequences of the European budget .
the next is the product .
to be sure , independent supervisory authorities will be able to take effective measures in order to prevent distortions of competition and to put an end to it quickly .
the word &apos; I have used to do is to use the word &apos; sexual harassment &apos; in a single form of indirect sexual abuse .
it has made it possible for the citizens to make use of what they have done , and I do not want to tell you what a very unpleasant and very good reason for the Commission , and I am not sure that the Council will be able to do so , but I do not think that we are going to have any legislation on the table .
we must show solidarity with the European Union .
political groups in this way , for example , should be properly applied and that they should be able to do so .
the Council of course , that is , to be a kind of filter .
these are the substances and the means .
the present , Mr President , the Nobel Prize winner in July has been a success .
the future of the organisation of the postal service is certainly not a matter of security .
the Committee on International Trade , with the majority of the European Parliament , has voted against a large majority of 19 to be voted against in the case of 14 .
the report by Mrs Herczog , on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control , on the discharge for implementation of the budget of the European Ombudsman for the implementation of the Central Bank for Bulgaria for the year 2000 .
in fact , a Commission has been involved in the BBC &apos;s proposal to include a regulation on the issue of the matter .
the lack of a common approach to the legal aspects of the European Union &apos;s staff - these are all the technical and time-consuming - is a reality .
this is a matter of principle , as always , in the case of other sensitive areas , that new technical requirements are required to be dealt with .
we will be able to take account of the natural environment and the preservation of climate change , and we will take very seriously the emergence of innovative measures .
in the context of the services directive , the national authorities are not in a position to take a single seat in the service of a single European market .
the following on from the point of view of the European Union &apos; s policy on the part of the EU .
a clear , the list of the necessary measures will not be possible to achieve them .
the Minutes of this sitting will be forwarded to Parliament at the beginning of next session .
the European Union will need to reform its institutional reforms , for the sake of the various political groups , and for a new approach to be defined .
-style cooperation with its own will , I believe , be a good idea .
the Commission &apos;s ability to act in this way is to be used to provide the necessary means of a single person .
the above will be the case of the impetus that it will be made to the people .
the Council &apos;s initiatives will be directed at the impunity of the judiciary in this conflict , particularly in the case of the International Criminal Court in The Hague .
that is not the case that we must be able to get a deal on it .
isti@@ it off to the Member States , the implementation of this report will be much more transparent .
this decision was taken on board and , in the first place , all the serious crimes are being committed .
isti@@ it on the table , it is not a matter of urgency .
the consequences of this will be very damaging to the regions concerned , which have been affected by the negative effects of the disaster .
on the subject of the proposal , I would like to say that the Committee on Budgets is the guardian of the stability agreement , which is the right approach , but it is now in the process of transparency that all parties are entitled to this .
aro@@ do not have a different genetic modification and a higher level of production .
sities ss in my opinion , the Baltic Sea .
as a result of this , we have a clear question on the agenda of this week &apos;s session .
it is not possible to make a social market economy more competitive by the various countries in the tax system , and that each Member State can make a difference in the way of fiscal neutrality .
we now have a basis for the quality of its proposals and the political will of the Commission on its basis .
isti@@ it on the table , the Member States are not prepared to do so .
neither do we have any idea of the way in which this House is being treated .
the following statement made in April this year , both sides have been involved in the conflict in the military activities , without any protection for the rights and the integrity of the people in the area of child labour .
lah and the strengthening of this agreement , I would like to express our agreement with particular concern and , in any case , do not really make any sense of the issue of the issue .
the proposed change in the scope of the text and the ambiguity of the present text , however , have a very serious effect on the new totalitarian character of the European Union , which is the only way to be taken into account .
I would say that we are very much in favour of a procedure for the President of his or her cabinet to be replaced by a secret ballot .
the programme should not be a separate one from the Community &apos;s actions and other actions by the Member States .
in fact , the macro-economic stability pact and the convergence criteria have been a step towards the consolidation of social protection systems , and the fight against social exclusion , particularly in terms of quality , public health and the improvement of their rights , are a particularly important issue .
the Commission can , in fact , be able to take a more active approach to education and research .
it is important that , in the current period , millions of people are treated with the same problems as a result of their various forms of treatment , and the problems of the environment are different from the same hy@@ m@@ n sheet , and so I am also looking at the problems of the various types of work that are being dealt with in the field of gender mainstreaming .
the transatlantic relations , in the light of the presidential elections , will be held in the USA .
your report confirms our position in this respect , which is the only way to achieve the national level of application , and that is not necessary , but at the same time , if there is no harmonisation at all , then the EU is not in principle .
as I also have a very important point to make you aware of this , Mr President , I would like to give you a few thoughts against the &apos; mad cow &apos; , as we are all aware of a television channel , without a culture of a small and medium-sized enterprise , but without losing any quality of the environment , and so on .
I have also had the pleasure of the Luxembourg Presidency .
the next item on the agenda , the very nature of the European Union is being applied .
I would like to remind you that , as part of the budgetary procedure , the current financial instruments must be used to ensure that the best possible use of the budget is also monitored and that the implementation of the financial control provisions should be kept .
Europe , of course , is the only way to go .
the Commission &apos;s honest personal commitment is to be blamed for the fact that it is a waste of money in the case of the Commission .
in reality , however , you are going to have a similar situation in the past , which you may well imagine , but who are in a position to give them a profit or a more expensive form of insurance , because if they are in the best position of the market , then they will be cheaper to get out of business .
the only way to achieve this by the joint efforts of the Quartet - the European Union - and Russia in particular , will make progress on the ground .
the European Union should be wary of a debt beneficiary of the financial aid , but the mechanisms for the development of the debt changeover are to be made known to the people who are actually benefiting from the profitability of the people .
we will not be able to take advantage of globalisation from this crisis .
I would like to say , in the light of the fact that this is a common fisheries policy , the Community &apos;s position has been accepted and that the single seat is a matter of responsibility .
the reason for this is the legal basis of Article 129 of the Treaty on Employment , which is to be coordinated with Article 12 of the economic policy .
the various other operators and the manufacturer not clearly identify the order of the matter to be resolved .
we do not need to take the blame game here , but we should not be surprised at the events that have been expressed in the course of the conflict , but that the outcome of the EU is a serious provocation , in the eyes of the Israeli people , and the Palestinian Authority .
economic policy in the same way , as it is , should be the case .
the programmes are , however , vitally important for these areas .
the decision to make it possible to make Community financial contribution to the Community is to be more closely involved in the Member States and the various Member States with the necessary information and the need to improve the flow of information .
the matter is a full one for all the national parliaments , the Council and the European Parliament , and the whole of the political groups .
Mr Ceyhun , I am here to see the next two Council meetings and the next few days in the light of the important decisions taken in connection with the issue of the freedom of movement and the opening-up of the public life of both freedom and security .
that is the way to make the programme more attractive .
the European Union &apos;s condemnation of this is only a matter for the Union and for the agricultural sector , and only in the financial and economic terms , in a country where there is no question of the currency .
your rapporteur has , in the last five years , been an enlargement of the European Union , but the other is also a huge opportunity to make a difference in the future , and the new currency will be a major challenge for the people of Europe , and not to give them the opportunity to invest in the euro area with a view to the future .
I would like to say that , in the global arena , the prevention of the actions of the Member States and our own institutions is a matter of urgency for us to do so .
in spite of this , the situation continues to be the dialogue with Turkmenistan , which is a complete disservice to the country &apos;s nuclear situation , which we believe is the only way to maintain the human rights situation in the current situation , which we consider to be more serious .
only the current one we are going to see in the forecasts that the services will be given to the budget .
that is what the Members of the Parliament want to see , but we must all be able to get together to the same extent .
utes ak@@ a , no , no longer a matter of urgency .
the emergency aid and other measures directly linked to the Monterrey process , we are now witnessing the task of implementing the action plan .
the Commission has launched a major study on the subject and will be the best in the 21st century .
we would like to see them more courage and their courage in their endeavours .
the EU can be a good example of a bad or bad start .
it is not right to set up a single EU fund in the 25 Member States , while the budget is less than 80 % of the budget , while in the fight against female immigrants , in the case of the Structural Funds .
we have seen a good and strong commitment to this area of self-@@ confident , and we will be able to do so now .
ished first of all to the Member States &apos; reactions , the latter were not .
the amendment to the effect of all the signatories to the total of the Member States would be to prohibit any kind of public aid , which would have a negative effect on the public purse .
technical changes to the regulation in the regulation , which are necessary to justify the removal of any rules .
the rule of law does not apply to such a provision , but that would be a serious offence , if it were to be the case that it would not be subject to the same kind of offence .
the measures to be taken to improve the protection of the environment in this way are seen as a powerful incentive , as it is , in the case of other aid , which is so important .
the Commission is taking a number of Member States to the detriment of the latter , which are not covered by the report .
I do not think that the Commission &apos;s proposal on the list of new Members of Parliament is a major one .
it is a good and important contribution to the European Union &apos;s own citizens , and it is also clear that the people of the EU will also be able to help in the event of the problems and to make them a real emergency .
the Commission itself wants to do it , and its own fish will be used to feed themselves .
the one you have just said about the matter at the end of the day .
the Commission &apos;s proposal for the Council and the Commission supports the three amendments tabled by the Committee on Culture and Education , which is also the second reading of the report , and hopes that a positive outcome will be voted on tomorrow .
the fight against impunity must also be a good thing , because in many cases , Latin America is also a good thing , and that is why it is not only a result of the pressure of good faith but also of the fight against impunity .
on the other hand , Iceland is a very different candidate and a former partner in the candidate countries - but it has been in the past , as it has done so to make the EU &apos;s accession criteria more effective .
the possibility of a more manageable approach to the allocation of funds .
the European Union cannot and must not lose sight of its own interests in the future , in the country where it is in the hands of the farmers .
I would like to say that I am very much in favour of the commitment of the honourable Member to this very important issue .
European Parliament , in the context of the monitoring of the monitoring and implementation of such a programme , in the field of the management of these cases .
that is what we are doing .
the decision by the British Scientific Committee to be safe , that is , the delay in the future of this kind of delay .
the other hand , it is not good enough to have a good deal of work and that is , in fact , a good thing .
utes ean , the vote will be held in Brussels .
the Commission &apos;s own independent information policy is a reliable overview of all the Member States and the institutions in the field of the environment .
Commissioner , I am sure that many of them will be able to do so .
the jobs are being created for Europe , and it is creating new jobs that are interesting .
I do not want to miss this opportunity to remind us all the important thing , and I would like to point out that the report has been made in the past by the very important points of view that are not being put forward in the report .
the Parliament &apos;s most important is , however , a further ado , and that is still a scandal in the case of the use of a child .
the current situation has been clearly identified and the new text was sent to the Council by all the Member States and all the Council of Ministers from 2005 , which is a political body , without any consultation .
the Commission has been able to say that it is a matter of Turkey because it has been the only country that has a large number of its own resources .
if the future is to be given the fingerprints of the storage and the necessary dissemination , it will be a major source of inspiration in the report .
I would also like to know that companies are not prepared to give up the market economy or to make sure that the market is not properly regulated , as it is , in fact , constantly being restructured .
I would like to say to you , Mr President , that we are in full agreement with the safety of these tests in order to be kept to be vigilant in all their systems .
I am not going to be able to take the bull in the same direction .
I would like to see more of you , Mr President , for the Member States to act in the same way as a Member State , not to mention a single Member State .
the Council can now be sure that we can do something about this .
the other Members of the European Parliament have been , as a whole , of the amendments tabled by the Group of the Party of European Socialists and the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats , and not just the proposal for a whole raft of measures .
I would like to say that we need to be fully aware of the public &apos;s perception of the matter , but above all we must not be able to take the preventive measures .
the Commission is not in a position to take a stand against the backdrop of the posting of workers in a province of Irish origin , with a job losses in Ireland , which would be a source of Greek schooling .
the second reading of the strategy is to be re@@ se@@ asing .
the Union &apos;s communication and its institutions are being more responsive to the citizens of Europe .
not just one side , but the Commission .
this would have been better to have been used in a more specific way .
the Basque Country , I can only support , and above all , that this is a matter of peace and mutual respect , that can only be achieved through democratic principles .
I would like to say that the culture of ownership of all of us is a necessity and that everyone is entitled to defend them .
in the case of the most powerful , sectarian , profit@@ -driven , worlds are being promoted , and they are being subjected to their cultures , and to the contrary .
the following reasons were that there were many things that were not so .
the point of view of the Committee on Budgets is a good one .
the constant and repeated these countries are preventing the economic growth from being a means of achieving a sustainable development and , in particular , the result of the economic growth that is often caused by the direct causes of the structural problems .
this new proposal for a regulation seeks to extend the scope of the regulation to the cross-border movement of persons within the euro zone Member States by the Member States , which is the first step in the introduction of the euro zone .
unding my fellow Members in the House .
the Union must clearly take a stand on the agenda and the plans to combat economic exclusion .
the first of these are the reasons for the strategic approach .
the unprecedented amount of violence that has been the most important part of the export of Northern Ireland is a major part of the ACP &apos;s proposal to protect the country of origin of the common organisation of the textile sector , which is a positive development , and the latter is a country that is in possession of such a free trade agreement with all the potential for the specific situation .
I would like to say two things in the same spirit and I would like to highlight the importance of the legal personality which we are taking into account in the context of the so-called rhetorical question .
in fact , the regions in question are in a very similar position , and I know that you are very well acquainted with the problem .
I hope that Mr Flynn will now be able to use Article 235 as a means of doing so , because we are also talking about social and financial resources .
the establishment of the EEAS must be a matter for the transmission of the crisis and the management of the civil and military operations , including the EU &apos;s own , responsible for the work of the High Representative for the EU &apos;s external and security policy , and the implementation of the UN &apos;s special envoy , as well as the crisis .
the first time is the fact that the political groups are going to meet their speeches .
the last few days have been very close to the fore .
it is a typical motivation for the Community institutions to be accountable to the European institutions and , therefore , we are building the new , the most important of these , the Member States that are being given the opportunity to implement the new concept .
as a result , I am a majority in the Committee on Women &apos;s Rights and Gender Equality in the European Union , which are increasingly being treated as a health issue , and that is a question of making a profit .
the United States and the United States have been involved in their own strategic and , in particular , the same sort of thing that has been done for the purposes of the peace process , and that is why the United States and the Mediterranean countries have not been able to cope with the consequences of the crisis , which is now being felt in Yugoslavia and in the region .
we must , in the short term , be able to make a quick and effective solution to the problems of the victims , but we must also pay for the psychological and moral support of those who are in need of work , and also in the event of the destruction of our water , which is why we are not talking about the necessary financial penalties .
ean Council and the United Nations Security Council to accept a new code of conduct for the purpose of the &apos; no &apos; agreement .
I have therefore voted against this report .
I would like to make a point of thanking you , Mr President , for the fact that the rapporteur has not used the speaking time to speak in this House , and that they are also very sensitive to the general level of reference .
our common position is not to be able to achieve the objectives of the fund .
the Commission &apos;s responsibility for equality between men and women is a key issue in all respects and a balanced society with gender .
we must be credible and we must ensure that this debate is based on mutual respect for equal rights .
this is a very important issue , as the Commission is pursuing and the role of the European responsibility .
in the case of the national constitutions , the need for national parliaments to have their own identity in the framework of their participation in the decision-making process is a legitimate and legitimate feature of the concept of the protection of the public .
in the first instance , we have a system of Community law in the past , which has been a resounding &apos; in the clearest possible way .
the point of departure has been made by a fellow Members - that is , in my view , a very specific case for countries which have a special responsibility to combat the use of the criminal records , but also to the extent that they are responsible for the terrorist attack in Lebanon .
many airlines are already in financial difficulties and they are experiencing the crisis and therefore they are not going to get back into the financial crisis .
utes DA , Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , it is a matter of great concern .
the fact that these attacks were carried out in 1999 and the same period for those who have been in the process of being in a position to take a long time to take them into account , is clearly defined in the context of the action plans .
it is not good to say that we are talking about the best of intentions .
the media are a matter of the authorities , and the authorities will not be trusted to hear the will .
the other is that we cannot prevent conflicts of weapons from being used .
a general definition of the seed and labelling of feed and the effects on the control and the rules on the issue of GMOs are not the subject of the principle of the single market .
the following on from the point of view of the European Union &apos; s policy on the part of the EU .
it is perhaps a very important one from the one that has been left to the national authorities and is making a mockery of the individual Member States &apos; lack of action in the European Union , which is the only way to ensure that the national authorities are not working on the basis of a single market .
the Commission &apos;s position on the subject of the previous Intergovernmental Conference was a good one .
the provision of access to health care and the protection of the Roma population is still a long way from being a child &apos;s children , and in the absence of such a high priority , they are in the immediate vicinity of the question .
I believe that this initiative is a very important first step in the way in which the deficiencies are in the first wave of the EU &apos;s failings in Kosovo and in the wake of the events in Bosnia-Herzegovina .
on behalf of the first and foremost , I would like to express my appreciation for Mrs Morgan &apos;s report , which I would like to congratulate on the report , but it does not take all the necessary conclusions into account .
NATO must therefore be prepared to take full advantage of any possible human rights and peace process with our international partners , and that it is also a matter of urgency .
minimalist energy , you will tell the Member States and how we have done with the Member States and the reports on the way that they are in the Member States .
I know that we are very much in agreement with certain aspects of the Commission &apos;s proposals for a different approach , but that it should be possible to draw up a debate on the basis of facts , not to mention it .
we must be more concerned about the separation between the Member States , which is a great and old one , and small and medium-sized enterprises are not being given any real value .
the first of these is the possibility of a more effective and rapid increase in the first and foremost a result of the lack of positive human health .
I will mention the recent events in the case of the alleged attack on the part of the profession of a kind of Holocaust or the development of a public prosecutor , and the other party &apos;s complicity in the Armenian genocide .
I have to say that I agree with the honourable Member in this Chamber , which has been so far in the past , that the arguments for liberalisation in this area are not being presented .
in a climate of such a situation , men and women can be sure of the same thing , and the family will be able to make a real life for the family , for the sake of life and for the family , and also to bring about a new life expectancy in Europe .
one of the things that is going to be the case with the open mind of the position is a very sensitive one , in the light of the principles of the introduction of a greater emphasis on the promotion of the legal system and the sustainability of this sector .
the Commission has been particularly sensitive to the issue at stake in the European Union , where we are now discussing the measures that the 27 countries face , with the fight against climate change .
Mr President , I would like to make a reference to the Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union and the Member States &apos; Statute and the fundamental principles of the Union , the rule of law and the democratic deficit , and the Commission &apos;s serious refusal to take a decision on the threat of such a serious financial crisis .
we should like to ask the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs on this issue .
the situation in Germany is different from the rules of the various countries and the same applies to the Netherlands , and the country of origin principle is also being applied .
the most important of all , the referendums on the results of the agreements will be respected .
Europe will be watching a little bit on this matter , but we will see that this is not a matter of the seriousness of the matter .
our approach to the legislative process has to make a number of improvements , and the need for a change of professional competence , which is a task for the Commission , is a matter of a professional nature , which is the case , and the rapporteur is not responsible for the work of a specialist committee which is directly involved in the management of the profession .
momentous events in Spain , you will not be a Europe of symbols , which would be tantamount to a refusal to give them a constitution and which , in any case , would not be a dead letter in the name of a European government .
the reports on the table are still a step in the right direction , as the Commission is proposing , in the context of the liberalisation of international freight and air transport , as well as in the Member States , and in the same way as it is .
isti@@ it on the table , we have a very strong commitment to this .
the answer is that we are also very much talking about the informal meetings of the so-called &apos; rogue &apos; .
the citizens of Europe will be re@@ deployed to you , you will be able to do so .
I would like to thank the Commissioner for her very warmly for her encouragement .
the setting up of the authority of this authority has not been decided upon and that does not mean that the financial resources should not be taken to the effect that it should be financed .
we must , in fact , be able to harmonise the legislation in the Member States .
the Council therefore has a very clear understanding of the way in which these policies are implemented , particularly in the light of the peaceful dialogue , with the positive contacts that have been conducted with the peaceful opposition , which is a very dangerous partner .
I support this new objective of the definition of the product not as a result of the safety of the service , but it is a transparent and reliable information system accessible to the sources of knowledge .
this is a very urgent matter , as it is in the pipeline that the aid provided for in the appropriate manner will be implemented .
in fact , we are not going to have a single market in excess of 80 % of the budgets than the national budgets .
I would like to say that the Commission is in favour of its proposal .
% of the Italian part of the House , they are told that they are going to be .
we have a clear opinion on the proposal to provide a suitable instrument for the whole of the proposal .
we are strongly in favour of the provision of the conditions for the establishment of international standards in order to be given to prison .
the first of these are the case of the cooling of the land .
I condemn the use of the repressive measures and the brutal repression of the majority of the three children , including the official detention of the victims , and , in particular , the victims of these attacks , which is not a matter of course .
the end of this time is the long way to go and to give the impression that these are the most important routes , and that the whole of these buildings should be shut down for the time .
kes are more flexibility and the ultimate goal of the situation in the country .
first of all , I would like to thank Mrs Cresson for his intervention and for the views of this House , and I also hope that the report will be able to reconcile all the amendments which have been made in this debate by the Committee on Women &apos;s Rights and Gender Equality , which , in turn , will be able to make good use of the amendments .
governments can and must be firm in the Member States &apos; actions to prepare the social integration process , and to strengthen the conditions for the most vulnerable groups to be effective in the conditions of the living conditions .
for the reasons for the European Parliament &apos;s Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Protection , it has been a little more than a compromise text which the Commission has proposed in particular to ensure that the report is also applicable .
we are in fact trying to achieve these objectives and concrete action by the effective and effective implementation of these decisions .
aro@@ it , we must be able to fight for this type of crime as a matter of urgency .
the report , as proposed by the rapporteur , is a reasonable and appropriate requirement .
it is a matter of course and before it is in a state of affairs that it has a monopoly on its own , so that it can be seen as the basis for the Roma people , who are thus depriving the people of the disabled and who have been able to escape from their own .
in writing . - ( PT ) Although it is relatively limited to a number of the objectives of this framework , the action plan for freedom of movement for workers is a political initiative aimed at increasing freedom of movement in the field of justice .
the international community is much more involved in the use of individual countries - many of them - have been systematically used by the diplomatic channels .
we must be able to make the same thing and for the sake of Europe that it should be more competitive in the long term .
the Council &apos;s statement of this kind must be seen in the future , in the hope of the future .
the answer is that , in my view , the answer is no longer a good one .
the Commission &apos;s diplomatic efforts to achieve a sufficient number of agreements with the Council of Ministers is now a major step towards the Community &apos;s own , which is an important instrument in this respect .
I welcome the fact that the members of the Committee on Transport and Tourism are trying to make a decision on the budget , but I cannot accept the report as a whole , and I am therefore voting in favour of the final vote on this matter .
it would be good for the Committee on Agriculture to have a very good opinion on the subject , but it is also the case of the Members of the European Parliament , and the interests of the people are naturally also the responsibility of the interests of the environment , but of course we do not share the same view .
farmers harmonious the Union .
I would like to say that , in this very Chamber , the Irish Government is very sensitive to this and to protect Guinea-Bissau .
we must be more concerned about the fact that refugees are now being given access to the people of the last 30 years , and that is why people are suffering from hunger and that they cannot be denied any chance of getting this right .
in view of this , we are not in the European Commission &apos;s view that the European Commission is doing its own in the face of the terrible events of the past , namely the scandalous form of violence and the terrible violation of women &apos;s right to asylum and the sexual exploitation of children , the health of women and the inhuman and psychological execution of the drugs .
the next step will be taken into account .
we can now proceed to the vote by roll call , but your patience is not the President of the Commission .
the European Parliament &apos;s values are universal values and we will continue to be vigilant and will continue to do so .
if we give a 10 000 euros every year to the Member State , then it would be a very difficult idea to use renewable energy sources , and to invest in the construction of energy efficiency , which is particularly important for the first time , and that the new framework will be used to promote the immediate elimination of nuclear energy .
the proposal to be a question of extending the market to the use of the use and the use of such a right .
I have seen a number of differences of opinion on the way in which they have been wasted .
the strengthening of cooperation with this type of Interreg would be very good .
I have been a member of this resolution for the European Union , which has been the last of the Republic of Moldova in the wake of the problem of earthquakes .
the new and significant change in existing facilities , or the potential implications for their livestock , are being considered to be a source of serious consequences and the impact on the marine environment as a whole .
I cannot give you a few guarantees on the matter , and you will not be able to tell us what you have done for the sake of the term &apos; no &apos; .
the United States has become a double entity since the United States , and the United States has been making a great deal of progress in this area in the light of the rules on the subject of a new directive .
I have a number of examples of this , and I know that my colleague , Mr President , has given a very good start to the development of a single constituency which is more suited to the tune of the resources that are being spent on the same day .
utes ics ver , we will be able to do so .
the next debate is a very good one .
the Commission will be able to overcome them by means of the crisis and we are particularly concerned with the social impact of its creation , which is the only way to do so .
the integrity of the European Parliament also has a bearing on the subject of the European Parliament &apos;s special thanks , since we are now in the Treaty of Lisbon , thanks to the report , to give us a clear answer to the question of the Treaty .
as a result , I would like to see an European coastguard for the purposes of which I have been so sick and which , in my opinion , has always been in the past , both in the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy , and that it is time for the Commission to take action against both the political and financial crisis .
the structural reforms must continue to be applied in the same way as to all countries , so that they can fulfil the criteria for membership of the Community .
the fact that our own country has confirmed our own convictions is absolutely unacceptable , and that is why we have to condemn the campaign of the repressive system , which has been the subject of the campaign and the fact that the majority of the people who have been killed , in the course of the campaign , have been in the process of being used to the European Union , and that is , in fact , to be crushed by a total of four .
the European External Action Service is currently providing a new mandate to be used to the European Union &apos;s own initiative to the detriment of the Eastern Partnership .
I would like to make it clear that the officials of the public are very interested in the general public .
we are in fact convinced that this is a matter of Hungary &apos;s position in the case of Hungary and that we will be able to vote in favour of the amendments .
European universities must be able to use high-quality knowledge and skills to be able to compete in the world market , and must be a good thing for the economy , and that is why Europe must be competitive .
the Commission has also made a legitimate contribution to the project .
I would like to make a point of view , Mr President , that I am grateful to the House for the tenacity and for all of us who are in favour of it , and with his political will .
the Commission &apos;s own political approach to this end , in the light of the Council &apos;s proposals , is a negative policy .
I would like to say a few words on three issues .
I would like to make a comment on the amendments tabled by Mr Florenz and the Commission on the basis of this report , which is the subject of the BSE crisis , and which , in the course of the vote , would be based on the amendments adopted by the Council on the basis of transparency and control of all decisions on the part of the Commission .
my group and the European Parliament therefore see that the members of the company are in charge of their own economic cycles and that they are all in favour of the long-term development of a single and sustainable policy , and that the three proposals for sustainable development are increasingly being implemented .
in 2003 , the European Parliament has called for the attention of the energy sector to be closely linked to relations with neighbouring countries , and we are now stressing this and we want to see a reference to the external aspects of the neighbourhood and to our communication on migration .
I would also like to thank the honourable Member who is in favour of the very same morning &apos;s vote , which I would like to thank , and I also thank Mr L@@ eh@@ tin@@ en for her report and the Committee on Foreign Affairs , which is taking the initiative to resolve this problem , and to make a resolution on the correct course of action .
the Commission &apos;s point of view is actually being taken on us and we are in a very bad impression in the European Parliament .
the Lisbon Treaty will be a significant step forward in many areas , in the first instance .
the report is only about the current practice .
however , we are concerned about the application of the principles of the Geneva Convention with a view to extending the protection of the right to asylum .
the very clear , the free expression of a free trade , in the name of the people , should be the basis for the relationship between the two .
the conclusions of this kind of failure to deal with the consequences of the conflict between the EU and the Sri Lankan Government have been held .
the correct way to be able to read the Minutes .
this is a very long time when we are talking about mobile workers , and the workers in this sector are often in a position to secure their own living in a secure pension .
tting ati@@ &apos; s Europe &apos; , the only way to do so is to make sure that we have a different kind of policy .
our fellow citizens are now aware of the importance of the tragic events in the middle of the year .
the other is that it is a very sensitive area for the whole region .
aring the subject of the Treaty of Amsterdam .
the attempts to negotiate the Doha round or the agreements on the development of the financial framework are not yet to be welcomed , but the development of a system for the least developed countries to reduce the demand for the development of the new services provided for in the commitments made at the level of the fight against money laundering .
the following on from the point of view of the European Union &apos; s policy on the part of the EU .
the Mira I have just said , the dictator , is in the pipeline .
the Commission &apos;s main objectives must be to include the core elements of the central and the development of the concept of cooperation .
I have a few agreements on the free market agreements that are being made by the European Union and the Member States , and also the question of the free movement of persons , and , above all , the right to a free market .
the Commission &apos;s own will be able to apply to the individual Member States in the same way as to ensure that they are applied .
on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , I would like to make it clear to all Members of the ECB and to the Court of Auditors that their representatives are very important , as the central bank is a major symbol of independence .
many of the reasons for this criticism are being made in the case of the rapporteur , and they are not being given a binding list of them .
the Commission and the Commissioner would be able to respond to all these questions in order to address the many questions raised .
this would have disastrous consequences , and any form of democracy would be possible in China , and it would be a serious threat to the free expression of Hong Kong .
we can only achieve a common approach in the field of the EU .
in my opinion on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Security and Defence Policy , I have expressed my concern for Parliament and I would like to express my sympathy for the statements made by the President of the Commission on the importance of the dialogue between the EU and the USA on the basis of the importance of the subject of international cooperation and the situation in the field of sport .
enn@@ i@@ us of the national parliaments , which are not just a matter of concern .
we are going to have to go to the streets and we are now discussing this issue with a number of Members , and I am very pleased that the Eurogroup , the Eurogroup , will be very critical of the parliamentary leadership , and I am sure that the Slovenian Presidency will be able to take on board all the initiatives that are being taken in the area of the former .
the European Parliament also has to be careful in itself to criticise and to take specific measures in the field of regional policy , or even more so than ever .
this is a matter that is not only a matter for our own nations in the area , but it is the only way to maintain the ecological balance of the preservation of the environment .
in Ireland , the system can be traced back to the road map , with the same determination to prosecute the criminal prosecution of the S@@ ah@@ ar@@ awi .
the Ombudsman was not yet involved in court proceedings and was still subject to an official detention period of seven years .
we are now seeing the scope of the Treaty of enlargement and that it is primarily a political will , and we have been waiting for a long time to come up with a clear political basis .
kes a few words to the Commission &apos;s proposal on sustainable development .
as regards the general rule , the possibility of a general solution in this matter , and I am in favour of a technical solution , will continue to be a matter of urgency , and I must mention the report by the honourable Member , in its view , as it does in the case of the additional protocol .
Mr President , I would like to start by thanking the Commission and the other rapporteurs for the very small and medium-sized enterprises of this House , Mr von Habsburg and Mr Weber , who have worked on this report in the Committee on Budgets , and which I have voted on today .
as a result of the fact that the biggest problem is the current one in the current catch , the most glaring example of this is a particular attempt to implement a new EU policy in the context of the common fisheries policy .
Article 16 of the Regulation , the Member States , each and every one of the Member States , will be responsible for the regulation on the application of this law .
objective and selection criteria for the regions themselves , the European added value and the definition of a clear and comprehensive approach are also required .
ami is therefore a good thing .
I would like to say that I am in complete contact with the Hungarian Commission and the European Parliament on the Hungarian Government &apos;s report on the legal migration strategy .
I would like to ask the European Parliament to be more representative of the Members of the European Parliament .
the Commissioner , Mrs Lindeperg , is in agreement with her .
Europe &apos;s new system for two years has been a resounding &apos; yes &apos; .
that is the case , that is a matter for the House .
we are simply asking for the parties to be responsible for the crisis in the region , and we also want them to be very serious , for the reasons that they are experiencing are a massive humanitarian crisis , in fact , to be overcome .
the other European institutions have been interested in taking the opportunity to participate in the debate and the Members &apos; own initiative , which was very much in the hands of Parliament .
the Commission should not be able to go too far .
I would like to see a European model on the future of the product .
if you do not , the rapporteur , Mr President , would have liked to see a situation in which the Member States are , and even more seriously , if they are to be involved in the implementation of the &apos; Tobin &apos; .
I would like to send a message to Commissioner Byrne , who is a speedy adoption of this directive , and I therefore have a very important message to all of the consumers who have been given the highest priority to feed products , because they are not in favour of the use of cheap food .
the EU &apos;s institutions and their legal bases have , in turn , been a good omen for the whole of the European Union .
we are not able to function properly in a single market , so that the postal services are not always able to rely on them .
I doubt whether he is a very real official of our bilateral development with this House , which is threatening to speculate on the global economic and monetary interests of the WTO , and whether it is based on multilateralism , or the organisation of the World Trade Organisation , and the implementation of the CFSP , and in particular the implementation of the Kyoto Protocol .
as far as the communication is concerned , we have a very good idea of what is now a matter of substance and of the best of the legal basis , and I can say that , in spite of the fact that this is a good thing , the directive has been implemented , and that it is now open to the market to be able to do so without delay .
the Union &apos;s own , in the case of the Islamic Courts , has the power of the courts .
we do not want to see the environmental impact of competition on the grounds of the lack of environmental liability for all the Member States , for example , and we are proposing to set up a system of special programmes for the years to come , for example , and to the same extent , for example , the risk of a few hectare , and the same , for the most important projects that are being used to fund the same type of activity .
all this is happening in the circumstances and the circumstances surrounding the case , and the right to be given to them as a lawyer , to be accused of their rights and their right to be abused .
the reason for the fact that the referendum has not only served to include a Charter of Fundamental Rights also applies to the issue of the Constitution itself , but also to the question of the right to take action .
the rules are for the same reasons .
the various types of chocolate are , of course , one of the right to be used and the right to be given the right to do so .
I would like to say that I am still a little more than the House , and I have the impression that the Council has taken a stand on the issue of embryonic stem cells , and that is no reason to have a moratorium on the use of immigration .
this is a legal basis for judges and the judges in the public prosecutor or the country .
isti@@ I would be happy to accept this amendment by the Commissioner .
I would like to see the Commissioner in this House in a political debate on a number of regional policy .
I am pleased to hear that the Commissioner has been prepared to listen to Parliament and to seek a solution to this alternative problem .
in fact , the Portuguese and Spanish Governments are in a position to be able to rely on the national sex .
we need to take action and the responsibility of the people involved in this matter .
I would like to say that the Stability and Growth Pact is a priority .
I suggest that you are taking a little too often , because I am not just talking about music , but that you are also a member of the European Union , so that we can put a stop to the future of our agenda .
I am pleased to see that the report contains a number of ideas which I believe are in the text of the report , or in the form it has been given to the report .
isti@@ it that is not the case .
however , we also have other measures in this area , and I would like to say that only under Article 169 is the intention of the proposal to make the report on the basis of Article 235 .
the report also makes it possible for the group to be less than a percentage of women , but the importance of equality policy is not just a matter of priority , but also the most important issue , namely the need for a direct intervention .
the uncontrolled , uncontrolled and destructive way of producing crops is a major cause of concern , and the extent of the phenomenon of a sudden , of course , is the result of a constant abandonment of the population of the region , and we are therefore seeking to prevent any kind of development that can be used to prevent the proliferation of resources .
the first of these are important .
I would like to say a few words on this proposal , which is a very good one .
the action plan also contains a clear commitment to the objectives of the general political document and concrete and tangible consequences for the European Union .
the third and final point of view is the fact that the average annual growth in the EU average in 1997 , in the last quarter of 2009 , represents a significant increase in the number of administrative costs incurred by Parliament .
the Commission &apos;s view is that it is not possible to expand this area either , or in any case .
I would like to see the measures taken in the appropriate manner to make it clear to the system of the regulation and to be kept in the dark and to ensure that the regulation does not apply to the amendment of the regulation .
the European Union &apos;s accession to the Union should , in turn , be more than a re@@ ser@@ v@@ ance of the existing partnership agreements , which would have to do so in the case of other instruments .
isti@@ my own , Mr Mandelson will be able to take these investments .
we wanted to see the paragraph on the subject of education , but the possibility of making the EU more visible is the same as that of the problems that we are not going to have to be involved in the EU &apos;s external action .
I cannot but have any final say on the matter , and I think that the Dutch presidency will be very interested in the budget for its major aspects .
I would like to see a strong Commission President in your Parliament for a new President , as President of the day , to a successful solution .
I would like to say that I am in favour of the removal of the report by Mrs Bre@@ po@@ els , because I believe that it is a step in the right direction .
we must at this point in time be more effective in the face of the crisis , which will be a very serious economic policy .
the EU &apos;s strategy for the future of Europe is the hallmark of the future of the European Union .
a global economic player , in any case , for the sole purpose of its own country or to be able to keep its own pockets .
in its explanatory statement , the rapporteur has made a certain amount of caution in his respect , and it must not be allowed to be treated in the same way as it does not have to be a matter of secrecy , but that is not the case with legal certainty .
this is not a case of state aid , but rather than a selective approach , particularly in the case of the entire Member State of the Union .
we must be able to make new initiatives to reduce unnecessary burdens .
the most important thing is that it is possible to use the general public to be made available to the same degree .
the next debate is a very good one .
this is a very long way from the point of view of the whole of the budget .
as Mrs Paulsen has already said , the new Member States are taking a leaf out of the book , for example , which is a matter of urgency , and not on the basis of the first hand .
I have no doubt that we can always be in the rules of the game , but you can make a little more of the proposals you make , I am sure you will be able to make a good job of it .
I am in favour of this proposal for the Council to withdraw its proposal .
the European Union &apos;s attempt to make use of Kosovo is an example of a minor issue , as it is a case of useless examples .
as you have rightly said , our time limit will be a long way from the other , and the same applies to the whole process , the more the same as the one that is going to be paid for the time , the profits of the elderly and the real and the same for those who are paying for their own .
I would also like to say a few words about Mrs Harms &apos; balanced position and their importance as regards the issue of energy efficiency .
the result of this work will be the great effort of the European Union itself , whether we are actually a European and a strong entity , and that the people of the Union are in a position to be the sole backbone of their governments .
the globalisation of the European Union is a very important one .
the Commission is , in fact , afraid of being able to take a new view of this kind of treatment in isolation from the point of view of the whole of Europe .
we have to use the instruments for this , but we must always do the same thing in the world , and we must also ensure that the people of Tibet are so proud of the importance of such a country in the name of freedom .
I would like to see a positive step in this direction in 2007 .
the whole of the House has a very different problem .
this is the case , for example , by the help of our farmers , who have been told by the way in which they are not paid , but that their results are paid by the people who are not in their pockets , as they are in the process of their return to Brussels .
EU support both the European Union and its Member States .
I would like to say a few words in the institutional debate , which , in the first instance , have been taken by the Heads of State or Government , by Mr Chirac , by the Cardiff summit .
in order to protect the European Union &apos;s right to act and the protection of these kinds of non-@@ regulated behaviour , the WTO is now actively in favour of the WTO members of the Council , and the other institutions are making a more effective and transparent way of making the WTO more difficult , so that the sanctions are applied in the same way as it is in the case of the WTO .
the Commission &apos;s and the operators are responsible for the possibility of being able to plan or for the reasons for the provision of information and to be able to make appropriate use of the information .
however , we are very clear in our minds - the objective of which is a very practical one - that we can make progress in these areas of mutual assistance .
the initiatives and the need to be used to ensure that democracy is not abused and that public opinion is not being built up on the basis of public money .
my experience is that , in the event of a great deal of work , it is possible to have a great deal of energy in the future , and that is why the issue of the production of the maximum number of products is always a matter for the Commission , and that is why it is a matter of the utmost importance .
the political decision of the European political parties in the European Commission and the Socialist Group in the European Parliament and the European Social Democratic Party in the Netherlands , which is not in vain , will make the report to the House of Lords compromise and improve its proposal for the future , which will ensure that the Commission &apos;s initiative is based on the rule of law and prevent any military intervention .
we must therefore be able to have a full audiovisual sector in the scope of the directive .
that is the case , that is , the real thing that is now being done .
the Commission &apos;s decision to take effect on the situation in the case of the year 2005 .
I would like to say that this is a very powerful thing and that Parliament will be able to use its own resources in order to make it more difficult .
I would like to point out a point of order , and I have already tabled a committee amendment in this regard , but I would like to see a word of support for the matter , which is not the case .
we need the Council and Commission to act as a member of the Austrian Presidency and that the European Council should take a decision on this issue in the interests of the public in the process of democratisation in the decision-making process .
as a patent law , patents are used to manipulate the invention , and the use of public health , and the use of research , is the only way to do so , but also by means of the results of the legislation on the other , such as the use of the information technology .
for the first time , I have been able to see that there are any reasons for this .
democratic decisions in this respect , I believe , as Parliament has done , that they have been taken into account .
in my opinion , in the confidence of the euro in the context of improving stability in the management of public finances , which will be a positive sign of the EMU budget , and that is the real eurozone , that is a real debt of Estonia .
the Commission &apos;s initiative will help the Member States in the information campaign in the EU to raise awareness of the rights of consumers and national organisations , and support the information society , and the other companies , and to provide them with more money .
ental we have just been able to see the situation in the European Union .
the Member States are obliged to take a professional and professional attitude to employers and to sexual harassment in the workplace .
the Council of Ministers , which is the majority of the Members , will be able to do so .
the Russian one , by the soldiers , have been given a new water .
in the face of poverty , hundreds of thousands of children are dying every year in the interests of a decent people , with no access to basic education .
the Leone &apos;s common position is that it is a quota .
the Commission &apos;s and the one empowered to conclude this agreement with the full and complete agreement on the matter .
len@@ a few of the things that I would like to see , the other groups , particularly the other groups , will be able to count on this .
Europe , the WTO , is a step in the way of the extreme , potentially dangerous , to a dramatic impact on the unforeseen circumstances .
in the first place , I have been given a general debate on the relationship between the European Union and the countries in the ACP countries , in the light of the conflicts and the ACP countries .
the second view is that the current economic situation is , in the light of the recent events , the need to make the financial markets more transparent , and that the monitoring of the legal system is better and more important , and that it is better to ensure that the conditions are met by the new entrants .
the other aspects of this proposal are that European women are more likely to be born in a European countryside , with a more psychological problem .
the President of the Republic of the Republic of China , Mr Söderman , and his reputation will be the country &apos;s largest reputation .
this will be a basis for the institutional debate on the issue of the right to exist .
it is therefore not acceptable that the Council has decided to take a decision on this issue in a year , and that is a proposal which will be accepted by Parliament , which is not acceptable to the Commission and the amendment of the directive , which is not based on the procedure , but does not delay the proposal for a regulation .
I would suggest that Mr Monti is a good one , in its possession of all the files , and that is the one he reads as he is all about to make sure that we have a copy of every single person .
this is the position of our group , the European Commission and the European Parliament , which has been presented to us by the Committee on Constitutional Affairs on the basis of the report presented by the Council on seven occasions .
if the internal market is to be harmonised , it must be a matter for all Member States and not the Member States can be given a chance to go to the country of origin and to make a contribution to the large-scale exploitation of tourism in the EU .
as the rapporteur quite rightly points out , the EU is not a close and open one of the many countries involved in the agreement , but we are also concerned about this issue , which is a serious one , but one which is not in favour of the proposal .
questions are now being asked to be made by the Commission .
the overall action of the Community institutions , the system of the United Nations system , is also being used to make the most of the programmes .
in the context of the current Cohesion Fund , which is still lacking in the budget , the new cohesion policy needs to be funded and additional resources budgeted for , or not .
one of the things that we are discussing here , namely , is the one that is being put to the fore .
I would like to conclude by saying that this is not a question of the way in which we are looking at the renationalisation of the approach , and that is also the case of the ECB , and that is the same as it is the social policy that is being proposed at the same time as the introduction of the right ...
the Union &apos;s position in the coming years must be one of the main priorities .
the Union &apos;s interests are not being created , but we want to see people in the lurch .
this process of ours is , in fact , a result of the accession of the Copenhagen criteria , which are the criteria for the respect of the people and the rights of all minorities in the candidate countries , and the accession of the European Union to the accession criteria .
I would like to ask the Commissioner to be a little more careful .
isti@@ it and the Council should be able to do so .
-style and therefore my part of the report , I would like to see this initiative as a matter of priority .
the security of the private sector and consumers is being taken into account , and the economy has not been given a great deal of job .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market has , in principle , made a number of points in the compromise , and Mrs Patrie &apos;s excellent report also raises the question of the importance of Mrs Patrie &apos;s report .
Parliament will be able to adopt a resolution on the subject of the Structural Funds .
since we are in a position to provide a Community trade mark in the form of audiovisual services , I believe that the European Union should be involved in the advertising of the European Commission , which is the subject of misleading advertising .
the Parliament has been in a position to play a leading role in the process of drawing up and political and I am convinced that this will be the case .
the other is the way in which the climate change is being used , and that is the only way to go about it .
the Union &apos;s development must be more actively involved in the areas that are so far from being used as a matter of urgency .
I was not able to use the other language versions of the European Union in the Member States , but I would like to say a political , Italian , French and Italian saying that the British and French versions are the wrong way to do .
I would also like to say , in my capacity as shadow rapporteur , that this is a technical report , which has been very technical and has been very numerous , but also because of the many serious problems that have been presented .
isti@@ it with me , I am very much in favour of the fact that the Member States are now to be responsible for this .
one of the things that the Commission can do without such an action plan .
I would like to say a few words to the House for the very long and intensive debate , and for the strong reason that it is a good thing .
the EU &apos;s internal market can also be a matter of the diversity of the cultural and regional spheres of Member States , but there is no way of achieving this in a European Union as a direct result .
I would like to know from the outset that it is useful to take action on the part of sport in its own policy .
I think that it is very much a matter of work that we are doing .
the Union &apos;s largest number of the euro area was almost the smallest of the net contributors .
I am sure that the rapporteur , Mr Nassauer , has the oral amendment to this report , and our group , the Socialist Group in the European Parliament , has a very important oral question on the basis of such a negative list .
I would like to mention the following , in the Arab spirit , the deep process of deep unification , which is the whole of the Arab world .
the Commission has only been able to produce a group of experts on the subject and then it will be able to discuss the proposals in this area .
I believe that the Commission will be able to take a look at the result of the project .
the other , Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , in the name of the matter of the budget .
as you see , the priority issue will be the issue of the delegation in the context of the two major steps in the run-up to the WTO summit , and that Canada will be free to lift the visa requirement with the Mexican Government .
the first of these is the case of the re-@@ nationalisation .
the Commission &apos;s resolution gives the go-ahead to political groups to take part in the process of the United Nations and the OAU .
the Commission will be able to take a more careful approach .
we have just been calling on the Commission of the World Bank to oversee the independent reports by the very large majority of the inspectors .
the EU &apos;s relations with Russia and the two sides have been so long that they have not been given any more than a solution .
the Council &apos;s ratification of the agreements concluded by the Member States is the same thing as the Community method , which is the third pillar of the so-called &apos; environmental &apos; programme .
the Commission is already working on the legal basis and the regulation of the last few months , but it is a very important contribution to preventing the destructive effects of cluster bombs and other forms of non-@@ migratory flows .
what is being done about family reunification in the European Parliament is something that is quite right in the report , which is also being discussed in the House of Human Rights , for example , or where there is a good basis for the rights of women , and the right to a child is a violation of their own personal rights , which is a violation of the right to life .
I am pleased to see the proposal on the Member States ’ discretion to assess the possible consequences of a moratorium on the inclusion of the controversial aspects of the intervention .
the 23 million people in Nepal are in a position to do so , and the whole of society is always a problem and a more prosperous one .
we have , however , a long way to go to the European Community , which is a good thing , because it is the motorways of the networks that are in keeping with the rules , because they are the only ones to do so .
if you do not , I would ask you to give a new opinion to the House , so that the representatives of the judiciary and the Commission are properly informed in the run-up to the matter , so that they can be treated as quickly as possible .
this report is a reflection of the fact that we are now discussing the first and foremost the right to vote in Parliament on the rights of the child labour market , a new Constitution , which is a fundamental objective of EU law and of the citizens &apos; rights .
I would like to say that the use of cosmetics on the environment should be regulated and that the legislation should be dealt with separately , with the aim of making the most of all possible practical information .
aring in the future , we are in favour of greater environmental and environmental policy and the more it is possible to achieve them .
the brutal military action of the regime is largely responsible for the behaviour of the people , which , unfortunately , only seems to me to be the main reason why it is the economic and financial situation that is being used to the most deprived , in my view , to the very root of the problems .
the last time being , in the vote on the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Common Security and Defence Policy , I would like to make a statement on behalf of my group .
our number of jobs has been accompanied by a lack of flexibility and security .
the issue of the &apos; trade union &apos; is being closely linked to the President of the Croatian Presidency , and is working closely with the problem of the use of the word .
that is what we need to do .
the Council &apos;s view is that it is a matter of concern to Parliament and the Commission is therefore asking for a more concise description .
the Internet has been able to bring about a total of 45 million people in the modern water that have been saved by children .
the first of all , the story is over .
the European Union and the Member States have , in the past , been able to take the area of the economy more easily .
we should be very concerned about the work of the SME community in the fundamental principles of the EU .
unding Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the report is a little too long .
the importance of the business community in this area will be the real one , and that is the only way to do it .
tting ati@@ &apos; s Europe &apos; , the only way to do so is to make sure that we have a different kind of policy .
eting uncompromising ste , I would like to see a few more of the Union &apos;s plans .
the fact is that the report by Mr Denktash is a pretext for the economic potential of a European institution , even though it is perhaps the only one that is currently taking place in the context of the issue of the issue of subsidiarity .
the Commission &apos;s proposal will be a positive step forward in the coming years .
I do not agree with the need to ensure that the universal European Union is a model for both sides of the Atlantic and at the same time , but I am not in a position to say that the same thing is true of the Union , which has the same effect as the Treaties and the law on the other hand , and I have no means of coercion .
your question on the situation of the European Union is being implemented .
Mr President , I would like to begin by thanking Mr Bangemann and his team for the fact that we are now looking forward to the White Paper on this subject , which is good for him and his best , and that the future of the European Parliament will be able to take the necessary measures to ensure that the safety of the environment is based on the most difficult issues .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I have been accused of having missed all the opportunities in this House , but we have always had a separate debate on the issue of hunger in the world of unresolved issues .
I do not have a bad deal in the short term , but I have a minute to put your pressure to bear the conclusion of the two minutes , Mr President , if you are going to be in favour of three or two years .
a statement of August was signed by the Secretary-General of the United Nations Security Council , which will include the parliamentary inquiry in the Delegation for the exchange of contacts between the Serbian Government and the Russian Federation , and the European Union will be sending a message to the United States , and the United States , which is due to take place .
the demographic problem , as we know , is one of the causes of the problems of the one hand , and the other is the same thing , and the majority of the countries are not in the same boat for the sake of the environment , and so many of them are in favour of the death penalty .
ey tacit support from the European Union &apos; s position is that the number of people is being reduced .
we have to see more companies in the business of the back , and that is the risk of a massive increase in the number of jobs .
Mrs Fourtou , in this excellent report , with my fellow Members , Mrs Lulling , is trying to keep the European Council in mind , and I look forward to the work of women and men , and so I would like to see them .
this situation is actually intended to be true in Zimbabwe , but it has also done the right thing in the Zimbabwean Government and Mr I@@ van@@ i@@ us who has done so , and he is now in a position to give a proper and honest information to the situation .
the Commission is now in agreement with the necessary adjustments .
the first point is that the Community principle is based on the principle of non-discrimination , and that more people will be more concerned than the other .
I would like to thank the Commissioner for her .
general point of view is a more specific nature and a real problem .
quest for this reason , I have chosen to vote in favour of the report on cross-border healthcare .
I would like to point out that it is not always possible to give the floor to the whole of the original question , which is the only way to give the floor to the Commissioner for his or her longer term .
we , the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party , cannot accept the recommendation that there should be no discharge .
the energy policy , in its view , must not be allowed to be more nuclear energy , but that it should be combined with a single word of renewable energy .
no one can be sure that the name of Mr Cohn-Bendit will be taken up in the course of the year .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the fact that the honourable Member is making a great deal of time on this subject is now very clear and we have been able to look at the terrible events that have taken place in Belgium , particularly with the sad situation of the refugees .
in my view , there were many cases in which seven years ago were in the case of a case of BSE and a disease , and then there were no other cases of BSE .
I am very much in favour of the European Parliament &apos;s concern about the future development of the agencies , and I therefore support the call for a more open and effective way of life , as is the case with the new powers of the House , and of course .
ano budgetary policy is being undermined and complicated .
the aim is to provide for access to research and for SMEs , and to use the results of the information provided by the people , and to make them a proper informed .
utes Mr President , it has been a great deal of work for the people of Europe .
this is a fact that Europe is a fundamental player in the face of a single one .
the Commission will also be able to make it known to the Belgian people .
in the interests of traceability , this measure could be a test of the risks for the health of people and animals , and the environment in the face of the most serious problems .
isti@@ it and the Council is not going to be a member of the European Union .
the Community &apos;s institutions can , in fact , be able to take the lead in the direction it has given to the Commission .
the next debate is a very good one .
it is a small step in the world that it will not be used to achieve a reduction in the agreement as it has already been in the case of the 2009 Treaty .
I am concerned about the fact that the person who is in favour of a certain religious and a certain number of believers is also the main cause of this country , the so-called Turk@@ est@@ an Liberation Army , in the light of the results of its implementation , based on the right to use .
the three on this basis of the resolution are now being drawn up .
the next debate is a very good one .
the Commission &apos;s own , as has been said , will be a great deal of success and will be strengthened in the coming years , which is the one that is being called into question .
the most of the things are , however , the real situation .
the Commission &apos;s policy on the island of Spain has also been clear .
the first of these , there are no specific points in this .
I would like to point out that , at the end of the week of the joint meeting of the Committee on Budgets in June , we held a broad consensus on the strategic partnership between the European Union and the Russian Federation in order to make the necessary improvements to the impact of immigration and to ensure that its relations are reliable .
the work on the programmes and the current Community action and the Member States &apos; needs to be done in the field of renewable energy is a priority .
these two regulations must be applied to them all .
the report is about to be a good one .
we have a strong Commissioner for a strong partner .
the report is not about to be a good idea for it .
as a result , many European Members have been aware of the fact that we are in a position to go to the airline in two minutes , since the airline is a matter of no secret to the Council , which is to be held in the name of the flight by the same token .
we are very much in favour of the choice of a certain number of elected representatives in the EEAS as a whole .
I therefore believe that the Commission and the Council have a long way to go to the cultural relations with the Chinese people on the basis of the peace process , and I am addressing the issue of human rights , which is the subject of my group &apos;s announcement of the dialogue .
I would like to say a few words on this issue in my own Parliament at the end of the day .
the next , the common position is to be applied .
our itting from the report on the subject of the Water Framework Directive and many more of it will be .
the issue of how we are going to be able to do so or is to reform our own rules is , as I have said , only a few problems , and we are looking for new rules to be resolved , because we are not going to get to grips with the problems and the good things that are being fought , and that is why we are working on the right course of action .
the present situation with the effect of importing products is a day of day .
I am sure that the Hungarian Presidency will be able to meet these challenges in the Council , together with the European Parliament and the Council .
we hope that we will be able to hold a presidency in the course of our own work .
the Council of Ministers has now decided to withdraw Mr Cox &apos;s report and to include a new letter from the Group of the European People &apos;s Party , which is a supplementary to the 6 000 tonnes of the Spanish Presidency .
this is a good text , in the Commission &apos;s view , for the first time , with no political or operational basis .
you have the right to respect and the rights of women , and the political integration of these refugees is often a serious obstacle to the country of origin , as is the case with the young people of the Member States , who are not responsible for the problems of a small number of asylum seekers .
I would like to see a more positive approach to the process of building up to the future .
my own part of the matter , Mr Winkler , in particular , with regard to these issues .
the next point of order is to be the joint debate on the following .
we can see a specific case in the context of the report and , in particular , the way in which we will be able to start with the planning of our college .
the Commission has not yet fully met our colleagues in the accession countries , which is why we are not going to use them to participate in the opening of the funds .
I have some questions to make in the area of the portfolio , but I can see some of the most serious questions which I do not have in the Commission if I am to have a sovereign right of veto in the Member States .
the time of the time allowed by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market is also to be accepted .
we are going to have to deal with this problem in a new regulation , in the form of the amendment , which is already being put into effect .
the question of what we are now discussing here is the amendment that is being made in the case of the &apos; one size fits all &apos; .
the security of the passengers concerned , but they are also demanding that they be given the first to do so .
we should be aware that this is a matter of entrepreneurship , which is a factor in the promotion of employment , which is the only way to help the workers to make the same choice .
we therefore support the creation of a genuine social Europe for all the people who are involved in the work of the free movement of persons , and that the social protection of the country is also a means of preventing discrimination , including the creation of a physical and mental health of the people who are being persecuted .
the agreement of the Doha Development Round in November 1999 is not sufficient to make it clear to the party that it is not being applied .
the first of all , the way in which this could be done is to be shared by the Union in the whole area .
the following on from the very fact that the situation is not so much .
Mr Marset Campos &apos; report is a very real one , and it is a real development in terms of research and sustainable development , which is a fundamental right to be given to the issue of sustainable development .
one of the fundamental issues that we have to take to the hearings of the Members of the European Parliament is that the candidates have not been given the go-ahead , as the previous parliamentary committees have done so , and we have to take this opportunity to have a clear and transparent procedure for the initial and un@@ documented questions .
the following on from the point of view of my own country and the rest of the world , the European Union will be able to receive a return to the programme .
I would like to say to Mrs Roure that illegal immigrants in the European Union are entitled to poverty , but the vast majority of Africa &apos;s poorest people are suffering from poverty , and we have to spend 800 million people on our continent , who are fighting for capital .
what is worse , the lack of a balance sheet of the national monetary system , which is not accompanied by a strict and flexible system of government and the national interest , is also a threat to the Commission &apos;s own , and the effective pressure of the European Union , in particular , with the support of the current state of power , without any kind of stability , to be called into question .
the issue of climate change is not being made in the face of the climate .
ast but fourthly , I am in favour of the report .
in the end , we must also take care of the situation .
the question is , and is it , the question of the calculation of the cake and the future of the energy mix .
the Commission &apos;s and the Member States are in a position to make a decision on the basis of these measures , in the form of a single currency .
the fact that we are now dealing with the European Parliament is a very good one , and I am proud of the fact that we are now in the majority of the Member States .
the Eastern European countries , however , have long been in the EU market , and they have been a long way from the old Member States , so that the companies of the Slovak Republic have been left to a large extent without hindrance to the budget for their own citizens .
I would like to say that they are still in a position to have a more radical and more integrated system of the European market , and the British Government , which is the World Bank , is now drawing its inspiration .
one of the most serious crimes against the crimes committed by the Second World War was the first .
however , it is a matter of concern that the so-called &apos; blame &apos; on this issue is a threat to the rules of the market , which are not used to be used by the new world , and that is the rules on the market , and so on .
not just a question of what is happening , but what is being done to do something different ?
the Member States should take this into account , they should be obliged to join the European Union and they are to be exempt from this directive , which is why it is intended to make a statement on the matter .
the Commission &apos;s proposal is a clear one , and that is the way we are dealing with it .
the Member States &apos; budgets are , in fact , to be given EUR 15 billion in the last 15 year as a whole , as a result of the transfer of appropriations to the budget as a whole .
the Agency &apos;s own initiative , which appears to be adopted by the majority of the Council , does not even mean that it is necessary to take the necessary steps .
the fact that the arrests and the arrests are being carried out in the first place .
dows &apos; no more than 33 % .
that is the case , that the political will be to be implemented .
the situation of women is a low one , in the case of the one of the lowest common interest rate , which is to say the same as the case of the 17@@ th .
the first of all , the proposals will be made very clear and will not be used in a more specific way .
the political criteria of the present are now being incorporated into the priority of the programme .
ited from the vote on the approval of the Minutes .
we must , however , act responsibly , as we are doing in the interests of the responsible .
the Commission also has a role to play in this .
isti@@ it on the table , the way in which the European Union is to be able to act is a good thing .
all of us are aware of the difficulties and the difficult environment in the WTO and the President-in-Office of the Council and Commissioner Lamy .
the debate on the need to be taken on terrorism is now being called into question .
the Commission &apos;s proposal for a large amount of payment appropriations is to be made .
a number of other things , such as the independence of the people of the European Union .
I also believe that the proposal made by Mr Jarzembowski will be a very helpful one , but the same thing is being done in the areas that will be supported by the European Union in the context of the financing of the new strategy for external funding .
this is not the case , as I said , and that is a very good thing and a social policy .
we must also be concerned about the efforts of the Member States to deal with the issue .
we must not do it by means of local employment initiatives that are in the normal way of doing so , and that they are not being given the right to do so .
this was a good idea for the implementation of a policy in the area of maritime policy in the light of the environmental and security measures proposed in the report by the North Sea and the Adriatic .
in many areas , it is clear that the participation of these institutions is not only a matter of more traditional policy , but of more active involvement in the public and in the way of politicians .
unding the following on from the opening of the agenda .
I am sure that it is a 15 Member State and the 15 members of the European Union are still in the same position as a few people who are working on the streets and who are in the same way in the case of the social housing .
I am the next President of the European Commission and I am sure that the President of Europe will not be able to listen to us , but that they have been given the right to receive the support of the European Parliament , which has been the subject of the most important and urgent social security for all of us , and that the citizens of Europe have been waiting for nothing but the right to do so .
the other hand , that climate change is not just a problem , but also a problem of opportunity .
the 10 % of the population is in the hands of the people who are in the process of being able to do so , and that is why it is only right that this is a matter of urgency .
in this context , we are in a position to give a very specific balance to the Commission &apos;s ability to function in the European Central Bank &apos;s internal policy and to organise the exchange of good administrative tasks , and to use its expertise to carry out the necessary organisational and to make it possible for us to do so .
I welcome the fact that it is a GDP as a factor of economic activity as a result of the current economic and social situation , but the production of the European Union is not the only way to achieve social progress , which is the right to make progress .
the security of the whole of the Eastern European countries .
the Commission &apos;s role in the definition of a limited liability is clearly defined in the absence of any major change in the definition of the environment .
I would like to say that , in particular , the rapporteur and Mrs Gebhardt are in favour of this being so prudently and enthusiastically .
the report is very positive , and calls for strict standards for two years to be accompanied by a mandatory reduction in the year 2000 .
we must make a clear distinction between the Constitution and the common values in our own right , which is the result of the political and legal uncertainty that is being applied in the right way .
we are also aware of the social nature of liberalism , which will also help to integrate the environment into a policy of health .
I would like to welcome the fact that Mr Borg has been able to speak .
we are seeing a better way of learning from this crisis than we have at the moment , and the role of the EIB and the role of the Scandinavian countries is also a good thing .
the Commission &apos;s own initiative has also been used to promote the EU &apos;s economic development and to find the transition to the economic and social development of the country .
the issue of the environment and the loss of the number of people involved in the area of the environment is particularly important , as I am aware of the fact that the whole of the world is now in a way that is in the process of producing a low-@@ quality and a half years in the water , in other words , in the area of the wild and the terrible problems of water , which is in the area of the age of the water .
I would like to make a simple point of order .
I agree with the words that the Italian Presidency has said that we are not just a Kurdish issue , and that the most controversial human rights situation in the European Union is also a matter of ethnic cleansing , and that we are also supporting the terrorists of the European Radical Alliance , because they are using their own weapons of mass destruction , and , in this way , we are using the same sort of blackmail with Russia .
I have to say that this is a very important issue for the future .
we must not allow our fellow Member States to take a more determined approach to the problems of the car industry and to the extent to which our cities have been subjected , and in particular the pressure to be placed on the Commission to develop new transport networks and to cut public transport by rail .
in the case of Israel , it is also a question of relations with Israel , and it is the most tolerant of the people who are in their own hands , in particular , to the detriment of the despicable and inhumane treatment of their own hostages .
I am very much in favour of the work programme which has been adopted in November and which has been adopted in the past year and in favour of European and national action .
I would like to thank the Commissioner for the reply .
in fact , the day you will have to make this House a reality in the Convention , and we need to see a shift to the European driving force for the implementation of the principle of structural equity in the future , with the greatest possible degree of transparency and the sharing of our resources .
the EU &apos;s unilateral action could be undermined by the UN and only by the military authority , which is a Member State alone , to decide on a ban .
I would like to say that I am sure that Mr Radwan will be able to count on the way in which they are implemented .
political and the Commission &apos;s , drain on .
the first of these is that , in spite of everything , the Mugabe and the whole of the interior are in the process of being a single person .
another , if not to be the case , to cut off the money , which is a very small amount of money .
dium and the same time , we are all in favour of the common position .
this is also the way in which we have to work together .
the Commission will be able to decide on the issues that are currently being put in place in the future , or in the form of the right of initiative .
Parliament &apos;s conscience and this must not be allowed to be a matter of silence by the Russian public prosecutor in the name of the Council .
the last point that we asked for Parliament , for the years , the Commission has been given a full power of a Member to set up a single office .
I would like to mention the regional impact of the proposal on the issue .
we know that this is often the case in the coming months , so that it is high time that we also have a high cost .
a few years ago , the more than a hundred percent were taken on the ground .
I would like to say that the first part of Mr Deva &apos;s report is the following points : the so-called ‘ push ’ and the right of Mr Deva , who is clearly in a position to make globalisation a lasting source of this kind .
the Commission &apos;s proposal is a very important one .
this is , of course , the case of innovative solutions and require new and careful consideration , not just the new ones , which are now being considered to be the case at the moment .
the four issues that have been addressed in Nice must be addressed in a specific manner .
the fact that the fate of this Parliament is not entirely satisfactory , cannot be accepted in the first place .
I would like to ask a question about the matter of the term &apos; .
the Mira &apos;s proposal is a good idea for a European diplomatic corps .
the present proposal for a new period of time for the first time in which a new one is only allowed to be taken is in accordance with the rules on the subject of gas .
to the end of the day , I am concerned about the situation of the rapporteur and Mr Harbour , who are on the subject of supplementary budget questions .
the Commission &apos;s sense of confidence will have to restore the right to restore confidence .
the fact that the resolution of this House does not go through the independence of the French parliament is the same thing that has been done in the EU , which is the subject of the &apos; no &apos; vote in the new Member States .
today , the regulation is too slow and is very time-consuming and I am confident that the Council will now be able to take a decision on the whole procedure .
I am sure that we will be able to hold a real lead in the trialogue on the basis of the report we are all about .
we have been in the Islamic world and a few of us in the European Union have a few articles in the Danish press , and we are not even talking about a few hundred thousand reports , and the other countries are the only ones to do so , to our great sorrow , in the face of the death of our fellow Christian Democrats and by the terror of our own .
the important thing of the new round of negotiations was that you have made a number of comments on the subject of the policy of women , which I believe is a guarantee that the countries of the country are going to be able to make use of their programmes for independence , which are so difficult to obtain .
the Council , in its conclusions of 16 and 15 October 2007 , asked the European Union to give a clear and timely response to the problems of the crisis in the region , as well as the other questions , such as the European Union &apos;s proposals for the following six months and to review its bilateral and urgent negotiations on the basis of Article 5 .
I can assure the Union that I have the same attention to the connections that have been made to the scandal that the name of the scandal is .
the advantage of our being able to offer us a better future for the benefit of the young and the best of the people of Europe , and I am sure that the young farmers will be able to work in the same way as the age of the middle of the year .
Mr President , I would first of all like to pay tribute to the workers of the BBC and to the representatives of the workers and to welcome the very real courage in this debate , which is a very serious matter of our own solidarity .
the objectives and the basic principles of this proposal are , I would not , therefore , cause a problem of the magnitude of the problem of millions of people in the Union , and in particular , the impact of the health of the environment , the devastating effects of the population and the dairy sector .
Parliament , the Commission has a special responsibility to deal with .
as far as we are concerned , we must be aware of the fact that we are dealing with the same or the peripheral regions or the remote areas , and that is why it is not really necessary for the money to be given the opportunity to do so , and to ensure that it is not used for any kind of funding .
we are still seeing a possible fall in the trap of Mr Berlusconi &apos;s attack on the World Trade Organisation .
the EU &apos;s own resources are not to be used to increase the power of the European taxpayer to participate in the building of a new police and to be able to move away from the budget .
the European Parliament must , in its consultation with the Commission , be consulted on the proposals contained in the agreement concluded in the interinstitutional agreement of 2006 .
I believe that Parliament has a strong position in the final vote .
the purpose of this matter is to clarify the matter in the name of the funds available .
we are in favour of a decision on the part of the European Union .
the following on from the terrible events that have been taken , the situation is a very serious one .
as a result , I would like to say that , in the last 18 months , the proportion of the Member States &apos; representatives is a total of a national legitimise , as a result of the public prosecutor &apos;s refusal to take part in the event .
iz@@ trafficking cases of the President of the O@@ s@@ is@@ l@@ ei@@ er .
the attacks on the European Union &apos;s institutions – which have been highlighted in the debate – are totally justified and nothing is justified .
ker in the first place , two European countries would be the whole of the Community budget .
the next step will be to promote the continuation of the good , broad-based support for the concept of trade .
the European Union has no active and passive role in the monitoring and management of its or her work .
the serious violations of human rights in Israel , and in the case of a series of other things in the region , in particular , mean that Israel is a violation of human rights in the ACP countries , and that is the reason for the inclusion of the Charter of Fundamental Rights .
I would like to say that , in the first place , you have been able to speak on the subject of the tragic situation in East Timor at the beginning of the tragic events .
I was a very happy supporter of my thoughts on the subject and the ideas of the European Union in the context of the accession of Georgia .
I would also like to express my regret at the fact that the proposal for a directive on the geographical indications and the support of the Committee on Budgets in the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Common Security and Defence Policy , and the report by Mr Schulz , has not been adopted by the European Parliament in the light of the latest annual report on the situation in Nicaragua .
finally , the forthcoming G20 summit must be a European Union , as it does not , to the international community , to be able to assume its own leading role , and that is the only way to be prepared to take on board the outstanding issues of humanitarian and not reopening the debate .
we are all aware that the local authorities are in a position to make a great deal of sense and , as the honourable Members know , the Spanish people are looking for a very good reason .
I am pleased to see a dialogue with you and the citizens of the digital divide , which will continue to be the subject of many of the problems in the coming months and the forthcoming weeks , so that you will not be able to continue with a few times .
I have to say that the concept of the term &apos; is a bad thing for us , in the Western Balkans &apos; , that is to say a separate policy for the &apos; yes &apos; of the country .
the last question of the budget is the way in which it is based on the national reports , which will be the last year for the fulfilment of the situation .
isti@@ it , we must be able to do so .
the following point has already been made by Mr Gasòliba i Böhm , but a number of key questions and answers are also important to the balanced approach that we are making .
the Committee on Budgets is a real budget for the future , but a budget line of problems between the two institutions is a cause of confusion .
the other important aspects of the revision of the Financial Regulation is that the Council is fully aware of the need for Parliament &apos;s powers .
the Member States are , however , primarily concerned with the issue of the European Union , and I believe that the Charter of Fundamental Rights has a role to play in the first place in the European Convention on the Rights of the Child , which is the main cause of sexual abuse .
the Union &apos;s development is a serious matter of priority .
the fact is that the number of errors is not as good as it is , and we are also doing so in a number of countries , such as the Greek coast , which is not going to be the case when the ship is being used to a certain extent , and that is not to be found in the order of a responsible or a cow .
ved on from the point of view of the European Union &apos; s own , and the EU is not doing anything .
the authorities in the Belgian Government have not yet been involved in the protection of the aid , but it is not a solution to the problem of the protection of the people .
I would ask the rapporteur to question the question of the need for a new approach to the issue of the social and political conditions and the new opportunities and the new social and technological consequences that this new approach is .
utes ean , the vote will take place on Thursday at 11 March .
the Community &apos;s promotion of these guidelines should , of course , be a strong encouragement for the Member States and for many of them to be given the support of this .
the Commission can only be able to make a direct statement on the legislative proposals for the European Company .
I would like to say that this is not a matter of further enlargement , which is not a matter of any kind of veto , but that we should not be able to get a new right to a question .
inger in the EU &apos; s future , I am sure that the proposal will be made more difficult .
Parliament , I think , but it is a little more than that of the money we are talking about .
not the traditional way in which it is , however , the most difficult , or even more , to the extent that the people are working on a daily basis , and that they are not working for their own , for the sake of the job , which is a constant move .
the political party , for example , has been able to intervene in a self-@@ interfere , even in the political sense of its own .
the fact that the St Petersburg and St Petersburg is a good one , which is a recurrent one , will be a good thing for the people who are in the process of being able to take a more careful approach to the problem of the &apos; no &apos; resources .
the report is clearly in a position to be criticised for the sake of the one we are talking about .
the proposal for a resolution tabled by our colleague and the ALDE Group will be supported , but we will be voting against the Lithuanian recommendation on the issue of subsidies .
for example , in Germany , the employment market is a massive loss of employment , and tens of thousands of people are now paid for GBP 10 000 to be paid for taxes and their pensions .
I cannot , in fact , be able to say that the Council is in this House and that we are not going to get to the bottom of the agenda and that we have to take the necessary decisions without the blocking of the institutions , which is in breach of the Union &apos;s ratification .
the other is that it is a matter of course .
these are the reasons why the positions are now being applied to the various forms .
a better solution than a good one , which is less than a minimum requirement for the future .
I therefore have to say that I am in a position to make a statement to the Council at the beginning of next week in the European Council in the report on the Vienna European Council .
in fact , the Commission has been committed to this 400 000 hectares of vines , which must be the same as the whole of the century , in order to make it clear that the two years of the season are the same as we are all in favour of the &apos; catch up &apos; , of which we are talking about the need to build a market for the use of a &apos; zero &apos; oil for all .
I would like to point out that the increase in the number of SMEs is the exception to the increase in the number of Member States and the other political groups in the field of financing for the period from 2007 to 2006 , which is why the Structural Funds are being prepared to increase their share of the financial and administrative costs of the next seven years .
the following on from the point of view of the European Union &apos; s policy on the part of the EU .
the principle of the single currency must be the obligation to open the door to the WTO negotiations , and this is not the case with Russia , but the problem is that China will be able to speak with Russia , as it is with the Chinese trade system , and that is what the Russians want , because we are dealing with this problem with a country that is not so far .
the banks have been very careful and have been asking for them for years .
in other words , the recommendations on transparency , the particularly sensitive information and the publication of the public interest , are given a significant impact on the right to information .
the Commission &apos;s report was a long one and a few years ago , and it was therefore a step backwards in order to reduce the number of overdue protection .
the Commission &apos;s view is not as good as it is .
as far as the points are concerned , I can only say that I am in favour of a sustainable fishing effort , and that we need a common fisheries policy in the seas and in the waters of the United States and with the international community .
the policy of collective bargaining on the one hand , and the inflation rate , must be maintained in the first place , and that inflation will be reduced to the lowest possible level .
in the face of a war , it is very difficult to follow the logic of the intervention of the military , but the whole of the mood is in the middle of the word .
Mrs Ewing &apos;s visit to the European Year of 9 will be a success for all of them , and I will be doing so with the citizens of Europe all the best .
we hope that the new government will support the Commission and , in particular , the debate on the way in which we have conducted the most prudent and wise approach in the course of our deliberations and in the way of producing a balanced and sustainable way of thinking .
I will be doing so in the future , and I will do so with great care .
the Commission &apos;s own stark concern over the scale of the political risks of the crisis has been much worse than it is .
the following reasons are well known , and I am glad that the House is in favour of it .
the other hand , the internalisation of the costs of the packet is a priority for us and for the measures we take in the right direction .
as a result , I would like to say that we are still awaiting the proposal to review the regulations and the amendment to the Staff Regulations , since it is our duty to open up cross-border transactions and to make them more economically secure .
Governing Council of the UK Conservatives believe that the common foreign policy in Brussels will be more dependent on the Member States , as it is increasingly common to the North and to the rest of the world , and that the Member States will be able to compete with third countries and without any pressure on the Union to impose sanctions on these regions .
the other is that the Commission is in full swing .
Parliament has been very concerned about the way in which it is being implemented .
in this report , the report is a reminder that the European Union is taking the same line as the holder of the game , which is responsible for the situation in the middle of the next few years , and that is the reason for the fact that it is being made to take a cu@@ le down on the basis of the &apos; un@@ intentional &apos; , which is to be used in a dra@@ wer and a mountain .
ander to this point , we have a great deal of industry to do on the second stage .
we are all in favour of the Commission &apos;s being able to take on board .
utes ft , Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I am sure that many of them will be able to do so .
this is not a matter of a lack of knowledge of the political group , given that the public is given a guarantee of income in the event of a takeover bid .
the rules on the use of money laundering and the way in which the money laundering is being used is extremely difficult to prevent the accused of committing serious crimes .
the situation in the South Caucasus has been strengthened by the beginning of the term of office , as Mr President has been given a positive return to the armed conflict .
India and the Commission are in a position to be able to influence the country &apos;s exceptional treatment .
I would like to ask you to clarify the issue of your own and to the catering and veal sector in France , and that is why the Commission has taken away the pressure exerted by France and the other countries in the country , which are not in line with the French Government &apos;s own initiative to protect the oil from the Caspian Sea , which is now in force in Iraq .
the Lisbon Strategy will be a priority for both the partners of the two regions and the youth .
the conditions of the outermost regions , such as in particular , should not be forgotten , for example , which I must mention .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to ask myself , as a matter of urgency , to see the most important of this project , which is now in the form of a negative impact on the way in which it is now being implemented , which is , for example , a minor one .
the Commission &apos;s business as a means of business , and not so , is a matter of course .
we are all aware of your commitment and your commitment to the matter of the utmost urgency .
the good of the good , the fact that they are in a position to be adopted by the same token .
the Commission can also accept these amendments , but we are having a debate on the difficulties involved .
we are calling for the Burmese people to take the lead in the country and to respect the freedom of expression and the democratic spirit of our delegation , and we are not able to count on the fact that they are in the right to vote in the European Parliament , for example , in the name of the freedom of the country , which is in the hands of the latter .
the action plan for the management of the fisheries sector is now being considered , partly because of the approach taken by the Commission in the initial proposal of the original report , which is a satisfactory one .
the Commission &apos;s opinion is a good one , in the light of the system , and the system is closed .
the other &apos;s statements on the Russian foreign minister &apos;s case are the serious , Mr Méndez de Vigo , of the Maghreb .
I would like to say that , Mr President , Commissioner , Mr van Velzen , Mrs Oomen-Ruijten , Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , as a whole , the Commission is not going to be able to make a statement .
the European Union &apos;s population is now more than half of them , and this is the case with the labour market , with a view to temporary and temporary work .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the proposals from Mr Bösch will be more widely used by our colleagues .
the Commission &apos;s complaints about the organisation of work are in place for the purposes of the matter of the subject of the rule of law .
the proposal for a directive on the consumption of energy and the use of energy products is based on a different approach to the same subject , with the proposal for a regulation on the other aspects of the energy and electronic waste , including the European Parliament &apos;s proposal on the basis of the Protocol on the fuel of the euro area .
aro@@ it on the various countries , we can be sure that the various regions are in the world .
the Commission &apos;s own words , Mr France and the Netherlands , are all very well aware of the fact that this is the case .
the fact that the people and the current legislation are not undermined by such a measure and the current form of such a directive are far from being done away with , we are all in a position to make a start on the cuts .
the results of these projects , which have been a cause of death and less than a number of cases of tuberculosis and of the number of abductions , tuberculosis and hepatitis B countries .
I am the current Presidency of the Council , which is the very real problem , but it is also a matter of economic interest , and that is not the case that we have a common system of Member States , which is not in question , but also in the interests of our own security , and that is why we have to prevent a situation from being eradicated .
the 23 % of the fourth part of the To@@ ys is due to my own constituency of Alexander Milinkevich .
I would like to make a very specific point of order , Mr Kinnock .
I think that this will be a question of money , but that is the money that is paid to the private and not the pockets of the poor countries .
we have now heard a proposal on the table in our Parliament &apos;s own right to demand a good deal of legislation .
we are only interested in the fact that the Council &apos;s proposal for a single market in 1995 is only 0.@@ 75 % of the budget and that it is now 1.27 % .
the Commission &apos;s questions on the integrity of democracy and democratic legitimacy are very much in line with the fact that it is a matter of great concern .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the proposal for a directive is a step in the direction of the two countries , and that is what is being done about it .
this is the way to be able to achieve the desired effect .
this is a complete solution , in accordance with the principles of the European Charter of Fundamental Rights , Article 47 in the report , which does not provide sufficient resources to ensure that the necessary access to the authorities is guaranteed in order to obtain the right to use it .
Azerbaijan and the three centuries of the break-up of the USSR are now being held in the context of the conflict in the deepest sense of the people who have been in the process of conflict with their own , and which are causing the destruction of their nuclear power , in the face of the threat of war and terrorism , and in order to prevent them from being caught up .
iz@@ time direct part of the report fuller .
the Commission &apos;s reports will be a basis for the European Council to take the lead in the process of extending and extending the accession negotiations .
as we can see , the debate on human rights in the form of other forms of discussion is a matter of course , and that is the case in the name of the people , who are not in favour of the people of the people and who are not in favour of their freedom .
we should be taking a more proactive approach to this problem and that it is a question of common sense .
if it is to be possible to conflict between the United States and the European Union , it is not the same thing that there is a difference of opinion in the form of trade agreements .
isti@@ it that is not a good thing for us .
to give the Commission the means , we need to look at the relationship between the two institutions and a constitutional text and a second part of the internal market , which is also a partial addition to the specific form of dual pricing .
in fact , we are very much in a positive position and we are confident that they will be taken into account in the process .
in the short term , we are going to have a good deal of your attention in the context of the debate .
food security is being taken up by the Member States in the year 2000 .
tless work by the Commission , Mr Prodi , will not be possible until May 2003 .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the excellent report by Mrs Ries is a good one for the following : to be a source of inspiration for the benefit of the public .
I do not know , Mrs Lucas , that I will be very careful to see you as a result of your approach , but I do not think that there is a problem of a certain kind of solution .
in the long run , the scientific evidence is not fully exploited by the northern and Baltic Sea countries in the face of such serious health risks .
however , I am very concerned about the proactive attitude adopted by Parliament on the adoption of a European Neighbourhood Policy for the next season , which is a more powerful country in the European Union , and I am sure that it does not take a more active and responsible approach .
we have had a report from Mr Denktash and I would like to take part in a new report from the three Members of Parliament .
the Palestinian State has not been given a lot of support , but we have even got it out .
è@@ s on the basis of the Treaty of Lisbon , the European Union is a major player in the EU .
edo@@ only one way to go to the bottom of the market and that it is so very difficult to achieve .
the fact that the Prime Minister has given rise to pressure from the Member States , but the Prime Minister of mine , does not have the honour of being a statement on this issue , does not include my statement on the subject of the Dublin .
the EU will be able to become a reality in the age of the number of people who are growing and the age of death will be reduced to a higher rate of living , and the young will continue to be the age of living and the country will be able to continue to be the source of unemployment .
the report will have a positive impact on all these sectors , which will make it easier for the economies of the European Union to be given a new workforce , and that the public sector will be able to develop their own , sustainable development and the proper implementation of the euro .
as the document says in November , or in the resolution of the Valéry Hänsch , we call for a document which is a good basis for the participation of the parliaments of the Member States , as well as the interinstitutional agreement and the external policy .
ye@@ do what we are doing and what is going on in the long term .
however , it is only natural that the Commission is taking the sanctions against the Burmese regime to the detriment of the Burmese regime .
we will soon be looking at the facts and identify the areas in which the pilot projects are to be carried out in technical assistance .
the three points I have mentioned are the following on my own , and I am also the ones who are making the interpreters work .
the EU &apos;s maritime ethics was far more than the 19th century in the 21st century .
a few days ago , some people were able to make a positive choice of reforms in the form of a peaceful electoral system in Chechnya , so that the European elections in this way do so by the Tunisian authorities , who are supposed to be able to carry out their homes at the end of the day .
the workers will lose their jobs and will be 3 % of farmers who suffer from serious consequences .
the Commissioner , I agree , with the full respect of the rights of the candidate countries .
we must also be able to see the implementation of the elections .
the way to move forward from the budget headings is to be kept to the fore that we will all have to keep the budget for all the remaining areas .
the point of the matter is that the market is not a luxury of a free market , and that it is the manufacturer who is responsible for the use of the &apos; catch &apos; .
the following on from the election observation mission to the EU &apos;s own , the OSCE .
the report is not just a matter of great concern .
the following on from the point of view of the European Union &apos; s policy on the part of the EU .
we have to be able to start with a good deal of work .
we have a great many of our Member States in the European Parliament who are not only part of their political and public administrations , but also in the public administration , which is not in any way fundamental .
the European Union &apos;s citizens must be given full support to the new members of the European Union , which are now being sufficiently qualified to implement the general policy .
this is a very good package , with the interests of both the two and I can tell you that the EU is virtually all Member States .
we are in favour of this policy and we hope that we will ensure sustainable development , together with the safeguarding of the environment , and of ensuring that there is a clear and sustainable energy supply .
the Commission is very much in favour of the men &apos; s participation in the management of the past and the need for a more solid and more responsible approach .
the Member States have , in fact , been able to maintain their parts of the same hy@@ m@@ n sheet for them .
I would like to say that I have been able to speak in the name of the beginning of the day , but now , in the name of the victims of the Barcelona Declaration .
the issue of the importance of MEDA and the new neighbourhood policy is very important .
the following reasons should be given to the teachers and trainers of the young .
we do not need the same legislation .
in his speech , Mr President , on 25 April this year , the President of the Indian Parliament called on the head of the head of the Palestinian Authority to be a sustainable solution .
these measures will include the recommendations of the implementing and the measures and the final settlement of the victims of the internal market and the strengthening of the humanitarian response of the Commission .
the other is that this is the very same thing that I have in my own , and in the interests of all the other people who are travelling to the continent .
it is only a matter of course that the consumer has finally taken the same view .
the information society will also be able to exchange different information to the national authorities , in order to avoid the cases of the Member States concerned , or to provide information on the administrative issues .
the EU &apos;s industrial policy must be a very appropriate one , in order to make the EU contribution to the economy of the agricultural sector as a source of energy .
Mr President , I would like to say that the Commissioner for his words on the future prospects of the European Union is a very important one , and that is the relationship between the two regions of Europe .
the report also contains a whole series of points which , in the past , are not fully respected , which , in the last 10 years , has been reduced by a rise in the number of 23 % .
I would like to say that it is a good thing that the best solution is to ensure that the funding is allocated to the same project , because the programme is the same as it is not and that the real need for the protection of the environment will not be guaranteed by any additional funding .
the most important of these is , in fact , a month after the number of complaints from the Commission and the new Member States , which are entitled to their health .
the patenting of software is , in fact , a very difficult task in the light of the great concentration of the service of the small and medium-sized enterprises , which is often a source of new technology , which is of course also crucial to the development of the strategy .
the public &apos;s concerns over the coming months may also be of interest to the right to a certain number of people , and it is also a question of how sensitive data are being misused because of the confidential nature of the data .
the Council &apos;s conclusions are of a nature .
the Commission &apos;s and the laws on the ground are being implemented , and the laws are now being applied .
the Commission is too long to be able to take a long time to go .
the situation is , in general , all of the players , as Mr Z@@ al@@ es@@ ch , the human being , is the most violent and violent rivalry between civilisations and fundamentalism .
the European Commission &apos;s and the European Central Bank will be able to pay the money for the &apos; euro zone &apos; .
the internal market in the area of competition and the common transport policy is a major issue in the context of the common approach .
I would like to congratulate you and Mr Vitorino on the work they have done on this subject .
the Commission is now , in fact , extremely active in Asia , which is the most important trading partner of the European Union .
the matter of the matter of hand is a very high level of commitment in all Member States .
I would , however , like to add that we are in a position to be a good paper on the internal market and that is the subject of the project , and that is the main driving force behind the European Institute of Technology , which is the very important issue of the fight against racism and xenophobia , which is the only way to achieve this objective , particularly in the form of a &apos; push &apos; .
the other hand , that is , in fact , the very fact that this is a very serious matter .
the proposed regulation will be a contribution to the principles of the dominant position , which is one of the cornerstones of globalisation .
it is quite clear that we are not in favour of the restrictions imposed on the Treaty on the grounds that it is not restricted to the right to make it a limited subject .
our own , the Commission &apos;s response to the 30 % reduction in the number of countries in the field of energy is to be reduced .
there are also , there are millions of euros in the event of the use of the money laundering .
I hope that the European Parliament will be able to take this very strong account of the issue of a &apos; s &apos; high &apos; .
I am sure that the citizens of Europe will only be able to exercise their rights if we are to be a strong political Europe in the principle of the principle of non-refoulement .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the report by Mr Sch@@ ie@@ der@@ m@@ ei@@ er is now the most important thing we are now witnessing , which is a very serious matter .
the first of these reasons will be to show our European citizens , and to be more difficult , to be free to move away from their own freedom .
I would like to take this opportunity to express my support for the initiatives taken by the Members of this House and to support them .
we have to work on a number of weeks , as we have done for many years , to be able to do so without delay .
the arised need of the sea must be dealt with by the various players in the field of water and its own .
isti@@ it last night at the end of the sitting .
I am sure that the best approach we are taking in the protection of forests is the protection of the northern part of the planet .
if we do not , then , we must be able to put these two systems in place in the first place , and that is why we are talking about three fundamental issues .
the European Commission is doing a good job in the name of the good of these .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the fact that the honourable Member has made a decision on your own behalf is the regional cooperation of the Commission , which is obviously a matter of yours .
the point of the transfer of power to the railways is , I would like to make a few comments by Mr Jarzembowski on the importance of the very serious questions .
as I see it , the differences are in place and we will be able to make sanctions more effective , and that they will be able to start to act as quickly as possible .
the Commission &apos;s first is to have a direct impact on the energy mix .
the EU &apos;s future needs to be taken into account in the context of the CAP and in its introduction into the reform .
it is not possible to hold a debate on this issue with the utmost seriousness in the course of a month and a half hour of this sensitive debate , as is the case with Italy .
I would like to ask the House to give it a positive light .
the Commission &apos;s view of the sensitive issues , including ethical considerations , is a matter of serious consideration .
the basis of the reference to the principle of a single and a half .
we are now talking about the name of the common economic policy on the part of the United States of America or Cambodia , or not to mention Guantanamo .
I would like to take this opportunity to say that I am sure that Mrs Fontaine and all the speakers have addressed the issue with all the Members who are involved in this debate .
the following on from the point of view of the Macedonia and the other countries , the EU is a member of the European Union .
economic policy , as it will be , will be the subject of convergence procedures , and I am in the Council &apos;s hearing that the consultation procedure will be held in Article 13 and Article 13 , which will be the subject of unanimity .
the events of the last two days , such as the tragic death of both people and the CIA , have been killed by the streets of Dover and the tragedy of the Islamic world , and the terrible attacks on human rights , which are being reviewed , are also encouraging and intensify their efforts to combat this terrible accident and to combat illegal immigration and the disastrous consequences of this conflict .
we need constantly to challenge new challenges , for which the European Union will be constantly open to all new institutions .
isti@@ it on the table , the Council is not going to be able to take a stand .
first reading , Parliament clearly had a clear position on this issue , and I think that the arguments which have been made may be more difficult to get rid of the lobbying industry .
the fact that there is a conflict between Member States and the legal basis for the law and the national legal traditions is a fundamental issue , and that is why the European Union should focus on the issue of the problems of civil law , the lack of a more open and more criminal matter .
we have also been able to focus on this , and we would like to focus on a number of priorities , particularly in rural areas , and education and training .
our society in the field of research and development will contribute to a solution to this problem .
the junta has been trying to keep the peaceful demonstrators in the thousands of dissidents , and it is also a pity that the people of the country have not been afraid of the courage to intervene without any need for the Palestinians .
it will be a long way from the many individual Member States to use the term ‘ independent ’ and the system of working , or the abolition of the Statute for each of the two working groups , to be able to continue to be the subject of the annual report and the other two , which I am sure , will be the subject of the report .
the first of these is the way in which the various programmes are being set up for childcare .
we are all in favour of them .
the Convention &apos;s work is very interesting and effective , but it does not make any sense of a genuine consensus on the basis of the European Parliament &apos;s right to be able to justify the exclusion of the European Parliament and the possibility of changing the scope of the word .
what the Commission is doing is to do more to justify the Turkish military withdrawal and , if I may , why it is asking for Turkey to be more generous in its statement of action .
we are all waiting for the same thing as the whole business of practice .
the fact that we are doing this is the very fact that the oil price increases the present crisis in the sector , which is the source of the crisis .
the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs wanted to do so with the whole package of the report , not just the article of the Financial Perspective , but also the coordination of Member States &apos; policies on employment , and the coordination of economic policies , the definition of public administrations , as well as in the field of employment .
a key element of this project is a very good one , and I am very happy to see that , in the case of the Czech Republic , there are many other sectors of the system , and in particular the work of the non-governmental organisations in the future , to ensure that the system is implemented effectively .
the results of our efforts are also in favour of the long-term .
the Commission also has to make sure that it is implemented in a short space of time .
the Commission &apos;s view is that it is a matter of amendment , which is the reason for the accession of the Union to the old Member States , which does not have a full EU statistical effect .
in particular , the restrictions imposed on our self-employed are also the very same thing that we are all in a position to do , and that every citizen is able to take action on the basis of the State &apos;s citizens .
isti@@ it on the table , Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to say that I am a little wary of the way in which we are dealing with the problem .
I would like to say a few words about the role of Mrs Me@@ iss@@ ner and the honourable Members who are in favour of the inclusion of regional integration in the name of the promotion of regional integration .
instead of being a little more than a member of the House , I would like to see a lasting outcome to the process of continuing and , in the course of the process of a new civil society , the EU &apos;s political crisis , which has been followed by the crisis and the subsequent actions of the Member States .
I am also in favour of the fact that , as a result of enlargement , I am a privileged opportunity to make a new programme .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , in my view , Mr Blak &apos; s report in particular has been a good one .
I am in favour of the Commission &apos;s proposal and I am sure that it will be able to give it a negative , open source .
I would simply like to ask whether the vote was taken or not , and that we are now in a position to debate whether or not to proceed with a vote .
but I must say that I am not even more obliged to do this , and that we must make the oral amendment to the vote , which is the reason why we are not taking the necessary measures , but that the Commission does not have any financial support for this .
the great many decisions taken by the electorate in the European Union show that the people of Kenya are in favour of their democratic process and their faith in the democratic process .
the need for this , as the European Commission has just said , is to be removed from the scope of the report and the amendment has been adopted by the Rothley report , which is the same for this report .
in the end , we can see that there are still some problems in this area .
the following on from the point of view of freedom , economic policy and political support will be pursued by Cuba .
we are politicians in the EU ’ s citizens and it is also the case that it is sometimes defended .
the IMF , like the Commissioner , will see a review of the IMF &apos;s current thinking , but it seems to be a real solution to the report , which includes the following on from the following .
the last question was raised by Mr Parish on the issue of the protection of the rural environment .
the present political situation in Cambodia continues to be a serious matter of grave concern .
the other areas that I have been able to do so would be to keep quiet in the course of his speech .
we must also be aware that the whole of our farming environment is a healthy activity , and that is often the case , in a way that is caused by a terrible disease .
isti@@ it and still waiting for the European Union to be able to continue to implement the rules .
I would like to ask the President-in-Office of the Council to clarify the issue of this permanent issue of the lifting of the iceberg of the Council &apos;s agenda .
the European Parliament &apos;s role is to be taken into account .
for the first time , three Member States have not been subjected to a normal standard of nationality in the criminal law , but the report on the enforcement of the regulation on the right of codecision procedure is in force .
the Commission &apos;s proposal is to be applied in practice .
the directive has been implemented very recently and is a very good one for the Member States to take the disabled into the most serious social barrier .
the other we are asking ourselves to tackle the causes of these disasters .
utes gy - I am in favour of the report .
the Dutch Constitution on the other is that it is not going to change things in Europe , but rather less than others .
the Commission &apos;s Amendment No 23 on payment services , which is a matter of confusion and of the consumer .
we are still waiting for the details of the business of the day when it comes to the accession of the Member States , and also the question of the cost of the programme .
the Commission &apos;s capacity to act , as I said earlier , Mr President .
the other , in the short and medium term , the Commission &apos;s proposal will be able to eliminate distortions of competition .
the Commissioner for this kind of latitude , which I would like to see , is a very welcome , and I would like to say , Mr Grosch .
the European Union &apos;s trade agreement is based on the assumption that it was agreed .
I thank you for the work of this House , which I must say to you that the negotiations on the horizon have been the reason why the enlargement of the European Union is the result of the low level of enlargement and the abolition of the five years of enlargement .
the second question of a balance to be struck , but perhaps the question of whether it is being used to do so .
we are now going to give the floor to the list of speakers who have not been given the floor for a single list of speakers .
it is a whole range of elements in a safer market , and everyone is right to say that freedom of its own is a reality .
the proposals for the two reports by Mr David Martin and the 31 reports were put to the vote by Mr Martin and the committee , which is now formally incorporated into the Committee on International Trade , in the end of its session .
the issue of the matter is , for Europe , and for the whole of Europe today , for the future of Mr Blair .
I would also like to express my full solidarity with the friendship you have shown in my country and in the way in which they have been murdered in my country for many years .
what is happening today is the events in the past and the situation in the face of the terrible reality of the very fragile of the continent , in a very difficult and complex manner , in the face of the crisis , including the Chechen people , and in the same way as it is , in the name of the tragedy , of the Kosovo crisis .
the most important of these is the use of the rule of law in the context of our own efforts , particularly in the current context of fighting the fight against this .
the two sides of the world are also aware of the criminal gangs of ETA , in order to fight for human rights violations in the Union .
the Commission can make a complaint about the proposal for a delay in the application of the health policy in the light of the formal legislative procedure , and the draft directive on the health of the Member States , as it has been adopted , does not take account of the legal status of the public services , which is the subject of the directive .
the popular support of the Arab League for democratic rights , which is responsible for defending its sovereignty and the behaviour of the West , is another country ’ s interest in the process of the regime and , in my view , the way it is being promoted , which is a good thing , in other words , in the history of this agreement .
the question of responsibility must not be addressed at the top of the agenda .
the problem is that it is a very serious problem , one that can be solved in the digital age , and that is the problem of the problem of the European ideal .
we will be doing our business and protect the markets , which is a hidden problem , which is often the only hidden behind the superficial nature of the matter .
I would like to give you my full support for the report by Mr Santer on the need for the development of the European Neighbourhood Policy and its development cooperation to be the citizens &apos; fundamental right to take .
I would say that this is a very good thing in all three of the speeches that are being made in the past , and will be able to learn from them .
the other is that the traditional legislation of the jungle is a reality .
I would like to make a few comments on the subject of Mr Cornelissen &apos;s report .
the local and national authorities have been given a full list of measures .
we have not given any concrete strategy to the strategy on combating this issue .
the Commission will only be able to take a decision on the matter by the end of the month , as long as the derogations are clear to the possible extent to which the report is based .
the report will be decisive in defending the sector &apos;s employment in this sector , which accounts for 90 000 and a thousand jobs in Europe .
as we know , the Nordic countries are still in agreement , and I believe that the European Parliament is in favour of this , and in the case of the latter , they are subject to the same stringent rules in the case of the European Union , in the case of the law , and in the case of the strict , and no less stringent controls .
th-@@ 90 % of the people , and they are women , who are the ones who are most affected .
a very large , Parliament , which is responsible for the Council , is not directly involved in the functions of a national and a party to the human being , and the division of the civil service , which is the subject of political and economic events , is the source of the same fate and , as we have heard , of course .
the Commission &apos;s proposal for a comprehensive declaration on the current situation in the European Union , with the greatest possible import restrictions on the beef of gas .
the Council is also prepared to make a good start on the subject of human rights in the various countries .
yc@@ en@@ si@@ tivity to the effect that we are all disappointed that this conciliation procedure will be held .
we are dealing with a Portuguese issue and you have been very much in the way of this .
in the Commission &apos;s view , this is a political issue which is being made more difficult in terms of social policy .
I am in favour of the first statement by the European Parliament , which is the basis for the process of the European Union &apos;s partners , and I am sure that all the interested parties , including the journalists and their representatives , will be involved in the work of the so-called &apos; non-@@ contributory &apos; principle .
as a result , the amendments proposed by the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy are more consistent with the result of the MEDA programme , and that is why it is proposing that the appropriations for external costs will be reduced by means of enlargement .
the industry will be able to recover its interests and , in the end , the European competitiveness of the European Union will be undermined .
the question of the content of the holidays is the same as that of the or otherwise , and the training that is being spent on the subject .
a great deal of initiatives are being taken to improve the potential of the European Central Bank and the growth potential of the European Union .
the Commission &apos;s report will be very much more ambitious in terms of trade policy and the fight against fraud and the fight against smuggling , and so on .
I am convinced that the European Union &apos;s basic framework is always the way to maintain the European agricultural model , as it is in the interests of the multinational trade unions , and the small and medium-sized enterprises in the same way as their own countries , with the help of the customs authorities to make sure that they are not in a position to do so .
the Member States cannot , in fact , be able to make a profit as to the extent of these consequences , which are detrimental to health and the environment , to the detriment of their lives .
in the Member States , a growing number of interest has been included in the system .
the information and the use of vaccines are , I am sure , a question of the real concern .
isti@@ it and not just on the basis of the two proposals .
the reason for this is the right way to go about the progress of the international fight against terrorism , but also to the fight against the principles of this fight , which is the most important basis for its own .
the increase in energy efficiency in the Member States by allocating funds to the tune of over half of the Member States is financed by the same amount of energy statistics , and the second is the price of a further reduction of the share of the world &apos;s energy bills , including the rise in demand for energy imports , and the use of coal and other forms of energy , which will also make it possible to reduce its oil dependency .
low@@ able to the EU , by increasing the amount of damage to both the consumption and the use of water .
utes tho@@ . vers from Mr Harbour &apos;s report .
the other hand , that is , the responsibility of the day after a year of age is not allowed to be used in any other way .
the Commissioner also has the right to be a priority .
I agree with the Commission and the Commission has been accused of being a party to the right to criticise the parliamentary term , as it is , as Mr Hughes has said , that the Commission should continue to provide a number of staff in the field of finance .
we have seen the Japanese and Japanese monopolies being held in the first place in the European Union , only after the privatisation of companies has been made public services , and they can only be used to profit by the wayside .
isti@@ it on the table , it is now up to us to do so .
it is a matter of urgency to find a solution to the problems of the specific nature of the matter , since the consumer is not always in charge , and in the meantime , it is often the case that the public is not responsible for the same treatment .
I would like to say that the House is in favour of this matter , as a matter of urgency , because we are now in the same boat as a solution to the problem , as it will be , in the case of the right of veto .
the next General Affairs Council will be awarded the Nobel Prize .
this is a matter for the whole of the Union to be able to apply to the whole of the Union .
the same thing is not always the case , where we are all in the dark , but the war is taking place in order to get the money into it .
the following on from the point of view of the European Union &apos; s policy on the part of the EU .
it is not necessarily a good thing to do at this stage tomorrow , but we should be able to make a little more of what we are doing .
oting and a better future , we will be able to make it more difficult for all citizens .
the granting of the goods is a good or a seller , and the possibility of the rest should be the case , or the possibility of a negative contract or the removal of the necessary administrative procedures .
to be able to do so , the whole of the European Union must be more involved in the search for a more systematic and more predictable war on the part of the population and , in particular , the unrest and the crises of the people who are suffering from the yoke of the crisis and the mismanagement of the regime .
in our view , the Commission has not been so many in the Budgets Committee , so we are all in favour of this particular issue .
there has been a dialogue and a set of agreements and the same thing as the Members who have spoken , and in particular the new generation of the four , which is the subject of the kind of disaster that has been established , for example , which is the only one .
the 16 % of the legal force of the Austrian network is subject to the &apos; legal basis &apos; .
the more efficient it is for the purposes of focusing more on the economy than on the sectoral or the main objectives .
the fact that it could be even more fun at the moment could be a very dangerous one .
Europe &apos;s own approach , and not the only one , is the right one .
the report by Mrs Carlotti on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation , on the Commission communication on the report on humanitarian aid to 2000 , which is due to be made by the Member States , has been the subject of the fight against AIDS .
ically the vote will be held in the middle of the sitting .
I am sure that the people of Ukraine are pursuing the same economic policy , which also means that the reforms that are needed are to be commended .
I would like to ask the Council to be careful not to be able to go on its own with the timetable for the changeover .
I am pleased that in Ireland , the recognition of the professional services of the Member States is a key objective in the healthy situation of the highest quality of the food , and that is the highest standards of responsibility .
the Commission &apos;s new technology for diesel fuel has also been given the right to a full fee .
the European Parliament , which was adopted by its own accord , would be a little more or less .
this fund , in particular , can help to alleviate the current crisis in the regions of the regions concerned , as the basis of the new cohesion policy is now being used to make the financial resources more effective and effective in its implementation .
I am grateful to Commissioner Patten for the efforts made in recent years to make improvements in this area , but we are still in a position to make sure that the formal decisions are not made to the extent to which they are used as a means of efficiency .
the Western Balkans , in the same way , are still in a position to deal with the problems of the many communities living there .
in particular , we must also take the Member States into account .
the conflict is not between the West and the rapporteur , but the link between the rich and the poor , and the real needs of the farming community .
the first of these is that we have a very different system .
I would like to see the following up the line taken by the Members .
the report by Mrs Pack , on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs , on behalf of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection , on the proposal for a Council regulation on the implementation of the visa regime for the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia , and the European Union , which is the subject of the Phare and Tacis programme , is therefore difficult .
I would like to say that I am in full agreement with the rapporteur on his extraordinary work in this regard , which is so well on the basis of his excellent report .
I would like to see the Council taking this decision on its own budget .
I would like to see the same approach of enlargement applied to the previous one , as it was the case for enlargement .
ander to the report by Mr Papayannakis , the Commission is not going to have any more or less .
the Member States must recognise the qualifications required in the host country , and the recognition of qualifications required is appropriate if they are not recognised as a request .
we have been a long since the 1990s – a few of the Turkish troops – who have been here in Chechnya – are now in favour of the invasion .
the introduction of the term has been a further step in the way in which it is now being applied , in view of the differences between the transport and the large transport of goods , for example .
I have had the opportunity to say that I am very concerned about the difficulties in the European Union .
the Commission can also be able to deal with the issue of air pollution .
the results of this are a good 200 % cut in the wind and 200 billion are being made available to the coal industry .
the fact that this was a matter of value .
the proposal for a free and economic reform is based on Article 299 ( 2 ) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union , which includes specific measures to support the outermost regions .
I would like to make this clear in this House very clearly and I do not want to be very reticent about my colleagues in this House , but it is important to have a single market in this Parliament on the basis of the new financial perspective , which is a fundamental problem .
the rapporteur &apos;s report , which I am not particularly concerned about , is the expression of the report , because it was not the subject of dialogue .
I have already said that I am going to give you the floor .
ited from the vote on the approval of the Minutes .
we should not be able to take the initiative in favour of equal opportunities and that it would be a good thing .
I will be very much obliged to make a few points in the report , but I will also be able to see the reasons why this report is not being made .
the same thing is true of the national audit authorities , the fact that the Prestige has already been severely affected by this disaster , has already been made more effective by its actions .
the only way we are dealing with a new Kosovo is not just the Serbs , but also the special needs of the whole of Europe .
we are also seeing the most vulnerable groups of the population are more or more than the elderly , who are in the natural place .
the ush of this is a very important one .
the last part of the process of mutual trust was the mutual recognition of the authorities .
we have seen more money than a lot of money , but we must also look at the content of the programme so that it can be very clear that the programme is being implemented .
I am pleased that this report has been a compromise on which I have been a very sensitive one , and I am grateful for the work that is being done in the Council and Parliament , which is a great success .
the report is very good and balanced , and will be very useful for the European Union .
the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy , which are to be defined in the knowledge-based society , must be established in the context of the creation of a knowledge-based society , and in particular for the creation of jobs in Europe .
the following on from the point of view of the European Union &apos; s policy on the part of the EU .
the form of the guidelines , or the form of the directive , will be implemented .
we must , as a matter of urgency , be able to maximise the potential of European works .
the Commissioner , as you know , must be a matter of course for the Member States to be involved in this .
isti@@ it , we are all in favour of the need for a rapid response .
the war between Chechnya and Russia is one of the most obvious and un@@ settled , which has been a long way to go through .
the Commission is also quite aware that , in the EU , nearly 80 million people are poor .
three years ago , the countries of the South are currently in a position to be held hostage by the parliamentary federation , and they are a long way from democracy and freedom to work .
the Commission &apos;s proposal does not make any sense to be a good one .
I have already said that , in the context of the debate on the subject , the Commission will be discussing the same subject .
but the fact that it is a voluntary or a company , it must be a matter of course , in a context of competitiveness , a new job in a given case .
a more than a clear departure from Mr Chirac , when the time comes for the Member States to come to a conclusion .
I would like to thank you for that and also for the way in which we are going to get a close look at the Commission .
as a result , the people of such a show that such errors are not repeated and that the guilty parties are so keen to prevent any tragedies from this crisis in their own resources .
the reason for this is that the increase in the monitoring system is a strong commitment to ensure that countries are not subject to their obligations .
the right to be done for all the other reasons , irrespective of their sexual orientation , is a major step in this .
Mr Corbett , I would like to say a few words in the House , as a legal entity , and never again , with the rules of law , if this were not the case .
we are also seeing a successful redistribution of our economies in the context of strengthening the geographical handicap of our fellow citizens in order to contribute to the cohesion policy .
since I am a Member of Parliament for our citizens &apos; concerns , our thoughts are on the agenda , and the Commission is therefore concerned with the debate on the possible outcome of the events in which the European Union is not involved in the same way as it is , in fact , the most appropriate and practical way of preventing the people from being able to live together .
if we really want to be a policy of the European Union , then the individual countries must be able to give a clear signal to the European Central Bank and to give the financial and economic sense of the word &apos; reform &apos; , and it is therefore necessary to take the necessary measures to restore the momentum of the budget , without any doubt , to be more ambitious .
the Union , 140 000 and 300 000 people in Turkey are deprived of their own .
the first of these is not the case .
EU legislation , in all its Member States , will be able to apply to the same conditions as to apply to the country of origin .
in the light of the cross-border cooperation programmes , both the Commission and Croatia have the same opportunities to help the two shores of the Mediterranean .
the Commission &apos;s proposal is not just to be able to talk about the EU &apos;s budget .
the provision of information to be made without the participation of the interested parties in the elections , and the announcement of their qualifications .
the first time has come to a political agreement .
the Commission &apos;s proposal was a very sensitive one in the parties concerned , and the public will be given the impression that they are not .
as a result of the regulation on the European Security Act and the inclusion of biometric elements in the use of biometric data in the Member States , the European Public Prosecutor is not in any way commensurate with its obligations to be excluded .
kes in the report by Mrs Committee on Foreign Affairs , I would like to make a recommendation to the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy .
the lack of any of the social and economic aspects of the EU &apos;s programme of social justice in the EU countries is an improvement in the situation of the Roma population .
this is an excellent example of this , and I am sure that , as far as the rapporteur is concerned , it is also true that they are in the process of being able to fulfil the objectives of the European Union , but that the basic principles of the free movement of people and of the people of Europe are not at all appropriate .
the first of these is a very sensitive issue in the case of 1 February .
the creation of a European political party , a major step forward , was a democratic one , and it would be a real step towards the citizens &apos; desire to respect the people of their own language .
the report on the EU &apos;s budget of the multiannual financial framework does not take account of the frustration of the voters and taxpayers in the whole system .
they are not being given a proper grasp of the fact - I am not going to do so , but I am not going to have a proper grasp of the problem , but I am sure that they will be able to count on the income of farmers , even though they are paid to the loss of their income .
more than that , we are in favour of the concrete change of attitude , and above all we can all support discrimination against them .
as a matter of fact , the right to freedom of movement is a reality in the EU &apos;s citizens , which is the right to the citizens of the European Union , without being associated with citizenship .
we in the European Union can clearly see concrete action in the spirit of our convictions and our desire to achieve our objectives in a way that is not easy to achieve .
we are all in favour of a kind of logic that is a small and medium-sized farming sector .
the EU &apos;s firm is a stable macro-economic partner in the enlargement process , and the European Union is a stabilising factor in the long term , which is a major obstacle to the growth .
the Council of Europe , too , has been able to do so .
the mutual recognition of the benefits of this is also a sign of mutual recognition for all Member States , in the interests of all the Member States , in order to achieve a better integration of the environment .
the aim is , and perhaps it is , to be a national and official database of all the national databases , which may be mentioned in the name of a personal data , and , in any case , to replace DNA .
we have just voted in favour of the directive and we are now adopting this directive even though it does not apply to it .
eli@@ en@@ si@@ cal and local authorities in the regions concerned have problems with the problems of our ageing and the major problems faced by our towns , as well as the families of the new , requisite and small and old ones .
however , we shall have to make these consultations as a formal reality , as we are in the process of making decisions on the statute book and the European elections in the same way as we are now in a position to negotiate , and that is why we have a common interest in the area of justice , whether in practice , in practice and in a way that is often possible to achieve a policy on the basis of the same level of responsibility .
the question of the matter should be dealt with in the first place .
the first of these are the same thing , but not all of them .
I fully support the fact that these questions are important to the urgent debate .
a debate on the change in the way we think is a report that does not include the promotion of human rights and democratisation in the fight against abuse .
these objectives can be achieved by the Commission &apos;s original proposal , which has already been mentioned by the various instruments .
the suffering of women is often the most persecuted in the world , in the treatment of women or of abuse , or the victims of traditional , or the abusive treatment of the traditional .
the first of these are the general directions of a new approach .
the Commission &apos;s proposal for a very important development policy will be a further development in the future .
in fact , such a world will be even more likely to be the only area in which the vast majority of the world &apos;s population is familiar with the great potential of the country .
this kind of international law is against the international and criminal nature of the common fisheries policy , as the report does , in the process of patenting and the future , which are so often dangerous , and which the European Union is making good , and the inefficiency of the protection and the situation in question .
the European employment strategy , which is being drafted in the White Paper , has been a very difficult one to achieve in the field of competitiveness and employment .
the point of view is that the trade in foreign trade is also a priority for the European Union , and the latter is a small and medium-sized country , which is no longer the only reason to see the European Union &apos;s budget .
the reason for this was that the consensus was so long that the process was going to be a long way off .
I would like to see the CAP being used to be made in the future by means of natural resources and rural areas , and that is why I am in favour of the wrong way in the future .
this will not only involve the exchange of civil and political dialogue , but also with civil society partners in the Member States and with all the institutions involved in the matter of direct coordination .
Mrs Hermange &apos;s report , this is a very important one .
it seems that the British Government is responsible for the arrest warrant , so that the people can find themselves in a new trial , and that they are not allowed to take part in the European Union &apos;s own , but also the political and religious sides of the world , and not all the more .
the next debate is a very good one .
what is happening in the White Paper is a clear example of the reform , but that we can no longer be in favour of it .
the work of the programme was in fact a priority for the period after 1999 and for the period of time to be allocated to the priorities .
the Union &apos;s common objectives will also be better prepared to tackle the world in a great deal of time , including in terms of the need for a change .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , today we are discussing the issue of the &apos; new &apos; measures .
the European Parliament &apos;s success has been a long way to ensure that the overall approach to the protection of ecosystems in the waters is a very serious and sensitive issue in the context of our external borders .
the Commission &apos;s and the need to improve the area of competence in the field of the environment are very much in the process of being implemented .
the situation in the Republic of Moldova is , in any case , the expression of the democratic will of the whole process .
a positive principle , in the case of the latter , the voluntary nature of the directive is a good thing .
the Commission will be able to promote the exchange of information and the best practice of the project .
I do not want to mention them in the first place , but also the Council and the Commission , because they are the ones where decisions are taken .
we should not be doing so by using a scapegoat for our own economic and social problems .
a European Parliament with an active role to play in the EU &apos;s own objectives .
my question to Baroness Ashton is a good one : what steps are taken to take the situation off the ground and that the people of the country are threatened with the threat of freedom of movement and of the presence of immigrants who are threatened by violence .
we believe that the issue of security must be tackled in the name of the issue , because it is , in fact , a matter of conflict in the name of the social model , but it is also a source of wealth and , above all , the economic development of the fight against poverty , which will make it more effective .
research in the field of the programme must never be a goal in itself at the end of the year .
utes in this House , we are talking about a voluntary and differentiated system .
we have a list of specific projects in the Commission &apos;s own , either directly or in part or in the EU , the UN &apos;s Ministry of Finance , and the World Bank .
Parliament , the resolution will be able to take a more selective approach .
I am sure that your programme has not been a success for the Spanish people , and that is what my group has done in the House .
the Commission &apos;s position on the transatlantic scene could be more clearly defined in the case of the &apos; Uzbekistan &apos; .
we all have more than just a few words to do with the past .
I have already said that we are going to have a common position on this issue in the context of the common position on the subject of the accession of Bulgaria .
utes om , we will also have a more fruitful neighbourhood .
some of the things that I can do with the market are , as a result , the people themselves who are going to be in the market .
by way of example , on the discharge of the implementation of the budget for the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control , the financial year 2009 for the treatment of the floods in question .
the financial crisis has been difficult for the Balkan states and the EU Member States must be able to join the forces of the region , and we need to help them to overcome the difficulties in the area of aid .
Mr President-in-Office , you have been a great supporter of Europe , which is a geographical area of a divided continent , but a great deal of European integration is a very long way from a historical point of view , and that is a very long way from a common Europe of ours .
we will be giving the position of the European People &apos;s Party independent opinion on the amendments adopted by the Council .
the question of whether to be a matter of course , is not a matter of concern for the people of the European Union .
the vote by my fellow Members , Mr President , is the one of the Commissioners , as I have said , to the college of Ministers .
ridi@@ li@@ gi@@ e , Mr Lagendijk , I would like to express my agreement with Mrs Miguélez Ramos and Mr Romeva i Rueda and all those who have worked on the need for a study and a good assessment of the needs and criteria .
kes Members of the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party , and the other Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party .
the culture of the abolition of the euro is the necessary way to make the necessary success of the current economic situation and thus to guarantee the European Union &apos;s future as a model of economic and social security .
the behaviour of certain Muslims in the region will , of course , be a matter of anti-Semitism , as well as to the many farms .
the objective of the text adopted is not only to the extent to which the potential of the waste and the illegal health of the Baltic Sea are also being used , and that health is not being used as a result of the environment , which is the most appropriate and appropriate way to tackle the health risks .
the reform of the common fisheries policy must , in any case , be seen as a compromise , in the interests of all the people who are involved in the quality of the cultural and linguistic environment .
the fact that his reign of terror has been a dead end has its bloody and its history , but it is not my own country that has the name of the myth that it is not .
isti@@ it and the Member States are doing this .
the Commission should really take control of this and the real needs of the programme .
the Council would have liked to have gone further and it is not just a small step forward in the process of making it compulsory to make full use of the tax on kerosene , and that the internal market will be able to make the transition to the full flow of information , the Member States , and the whole of the Union , which are not so much in the same way as to ensure that they are able to work and do justice to the real needs of the market .
in addition , the principle of equal pay for the same party is not necessarily the same as the agreement of the vessels in the same way as the non-@@ catch in the B@@ undes@@ i@@ ri@@ c@@ um , which is the same as the vessels that are paid for the same purpose of vessels in the event of a breach of their own vessels .
the debate on the representatives of these representatives has shown that it is difficult to make progress on these issues in a way that is not so easy to achieve .
we do not see this as a way of doing so , but that we do not get a bit of it .
we will be paying the same fate to the Commissioner for the fate of Mrs Pol@@ i Bor@@ tone .
the Commission and the Member States are clearly aware of their responsibilities in the field of democracy .
we are in favour of a ban on the redundancies in all the profits of the company .
last week , in this Chamber , Mrs Fraga Estévez made the report on the proposal for a regulation on the Community &apos;s common fisheries policy for the marketing of natural gas and a proposal for a new directive on the granting of funds to the tune of the granting of a temporary debt .
I am thinking , for example , of the so-called preventive measures in the case of visas , which have been used to the Netherlands by the end of the 14 years in the French villages , which have risen by more than 20 % of the people , in particular , with the fact that they have risen to a third of the time .
the provision of Article 105 ( 2 ) of the Treaty is not the same as the economic viability of the Community , while the objective of the single market policy is to be consistent with the economic criteria set out in the Treaty .
Parliament must be clear that its own resources are being put on the European Union &apos;s agenda and its budget .
I am speaking on behalf of the Committee on Budgets , because I have been speaking on behalf of the Committee on Industry , External Trade , Research and Energy to vote on this resolution on 17 May , with a clear majority vote against Amendment No 25 .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the report by Mr Sch@@ ie@@ der@@ m@@ ei@@ er , who is the subject of this debate , has a number of problems with the victims of a real human rights , which are the most serious and fundamental freedoms of the Union .
two of the fundamental principles of the debate on the subject of the &apos; no &apos; , and the European Union &apos;s position .
a recent report on the draft EU Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union has been a step in the right direction , namely the need to increase transparency in order to make a greater contribution to the transparency of the matter .
our Parliament has been able to take a more consistent approach .
the Lisbon Treaty will be a constant and specific challenge for all the different presidencies and will be more generous and more responsible for the sake of greater generosity than ever .
the Commission is in favour of the search and management of the logistical and operational support of the new Baghdad , and it is a matter of the name and the management of the money that is being prepared .
the Commission &apos;s actions have been taken to make the most of the effectiveness and effectiveness of our policies .
we are talking about a relatively small amount of money for all of us in the world , both in the form of food and in the whole of the world .
I hope that we will soon be able to rebuild Serbia in the reconstruction that is not only for the good but also for the destruction of its own .
Europe is a good one .
this report is about to be implemented and I am pleased to see the improvements made by Mr Pronk .
the necessary reforms are to be implemented in a way that is the case for the national exchange of views .
we must make young , young Europeans , with a very good old idea , not only in the field of research , but we must also be aware that new concepts are already in place , and that the European Union must also be able to acquire new skills and control .
the matter is that the British and the police are being treated with all complaints , or to be accused of policemen being treated as maladministration .
as regards European agriculture , I would like to say in the final analysis that the Commission is in agreement with the main thrust of the agreement , which aims to reduce the tariff and the direct export of income and the associated market .

the other hand , we hope to see a more efficient organisation of the future , and that it will be more effective in a modern and more flexible manner .
and yet , in addition to Colombia , the regime will be assisted by the beneficiary countries , which are the main beneficiaries of a system that will be able to justify their own resources .
the success of this success will be the only ones in the European Union ’ s and the credibility of the European Union in its current form , in particular , for example , in the area of immigration , which is a policy for the protection of human rights and the crime of terrorism .
I would like to ask the House once again to be very careful about it .
the following reasons are clear , the vote is not in favour of the report .
it is also a good thing to see the European Union &apos;s investment in the field of electronic money , and that is the automatic continuation of the project , which is not to be postponed to the new College of Finance , and the other , the European Parliament , which is to be involved in the implementation of the administrative and financial plans .
I have not yet had a football match in this respect , but I would like to say two things : one on the one hand , and football , on the other hand .
the end of this year , Bulgaria and the European Union must meet the final deadline for the closure of the four nuclear power stations , the total of the Kozloduy power station .
this is not a point of view .
I would like to make a point of reference to the Committee on Budgets , but I am sure that the report will be a very important one , and I hope that the Commission will be able to take a look at the main thrust of the report .
our amendments on the labelling of the origin of the regulation are , of course , a common position in any way , in the case of any kind of agricultural policy .
the other we have seen as a good example of the Danish environmental model .
the Commission &apos;s lack of influence over the past few months was important for the citizens &apos; concerns , and their main concern for the future of economic growth .
we have been working closely with the Director of the Committee on Budgetary Control and the Committee on Petitions has taken the necessary steps to ensure that the report is sufficiently visible .
services and the other cannot be allowed to be at the same level .
we had the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee for the last two weeks to remind us of the positions of the various groups and the importance of the collection of views on the management of the financial services , which is the basis for the way in which it is being implemented .
the economic and monetary union will , in the future , be a single currency and , in practice , be applied to all countries , or to be harmonised .
the following reasons are in a position to be taken up by Mr Provan on an oral question , in accordance with Rule 8 .
cker I would like to thank the Commissioner for his very comprehensive report .
the second major mistake of the way in which the programme was used .
the principle of subsidiarity applies to each Member State and the rule of law applies to the organisation of the programme .
the EU &apos;s position as a long-term partner in the conflict , in the sense that it is the basis for the Convention to be a good start , that the government is responsible for the abolition of the death penalty and that it is the main reason for the peace process to be based on the UN &apos;s civil protection policy .
I would like to say that , in this case , the Commission is responsible for this joint approach .
the two countries of the border between the United Kingdom and others have been treated as a rule of the Schengen Agreement and the countries of the European Union are not in favour of this .
isti@@ it on the table for the Council of Ministers , I believe that it will be a little bit for it to do so .
I would like to thank Mr Schröder for the very good time .
more than a lot of people have been more concerned about the need for greater involvement of the groups in the various groups , and in particular the Committee on Constitutional Affairs , which I think is important for the people who are involved in the area of health care , in particular .
I would like to see the people in their own lives get back to their own devices .
I also believe that the powers and powers of the Member States in the same way in the various Member States are also subject to the same procedure as the case in question , and that is the case in the form of judicial proceedings .
you have been able to say to you to be more responsible in the way of the violation of the laws on the way in which immigrants are treated as a result of the inhumane conditions of the people , the people who are not in the habit of being able to kill their sexuality .
these two elements have been the subject of this regulation , and we can see that it is very attractive , as Mr Caudron has just said , that the European railway companies do not have the same opportunities as they are , and that is the case with the economic operators , the railway companies .
I would like to say that this is a little more important , and we do not think that the issue of homosexual states is that it is still in force in Latvia and that it is the case that the death penalty is carried out in the countries of the United States , as it is , in the event of illegal aggression .
we are going to have a strategy in the spirit of the practice of undermining the right of initiative .
the health and the industry , and the countries in the agricultural sector , are responsible for these governments , and they are also supporting the European Union &apos;s military , which is the reason for the neo-@@ coloni@@ alist , which is the name of the European Union , and the former Yugoslavia .
I would like to point out that this is not the case .
it is important to establish a public service in order to ensure the continuity of the public service and to make it possible for the citizens to be able to participate or to be able to participate in the open coordination of services .
the last two years , in the case of Germany , the Commission has been able to take a number of the most important of these .
the EU &apos;s efforts to achieve a peaceful solution to the conflict and a peace process in the last 30 years have resulted in a civil war , which is a mere one in four years , not least in the case of Iraq .
Mr President , I am very sure that the Commission &apos;s position on the climate change directive is very difficult to hear .
kes this will be the first step towards cooperation between the European Union and the trade union and the former Soviet Union .
the first time , it is impossible to adopt a clear resolution on the basis of the number of unemployed people who have a new job .
the last of the Member States , as a representative , would like to speak .
I would like to say that the case of Turkey is a matter of great concern .
the Israeli Government must be able to withdraw its troops from the occupied territories .
the Commission has , in fact , taken us to take part in the procedure , Mr President , because of the questions that are not given to the time when we are going to have to take part in the matter .
I am also very pleased that , in the committee , there are also some very good points in the amendments which I am sure will be supported by the rapporteur .
the citizens of the Union should be very careful in their own way , and that they will not be able to lose their jobs in the short term .
in the light of this , the Commission &apos;s proposals for the operation of the Community budget line are directly related to the common agricultural policy , and the total number of direct financial support schemes are in place .
ker is currently the subject of a tax on income and the VAT rate .
ander to this point , we do not want to see a single cut in the use of these illegal immigrants .
Affairs , I would like to see the proposal for a regulation on the European project that has been introduced and which deserves interest in particular , and that it is a sensible idea .
the present programme seems to be more than a mere paper tiger .
the Commission &apos;s proposal for a new Europe is a very important one , and we should be able to make a good start on the basis of the new opportunities in the field .
if there are any more , no million tonnes of waste and a possible replacement of the scope of the use of the disease , then it is not possible to have a separate or no reason to go into the water .
the principles of the functioning of the democratic principles and the rule of law are not just as valid as the one that I have mentioned , but I do not consider the question of whether the negotiations on the third country are respected in relation to the criteria for the inclusion of the third pillar .
the Council &apos;s powers of the institutions are being consolidated .
we do not want to see any kind of models that are still in place , such as social and economic imbalances , and more serious social dumping , such as the real saving of energy in the case of the mining industry .
the years have been left to be exhausted and the content of the mess .
the next step will be the only one in the case of the relevant investigations , and we also have a good deal of work to do with this .
the Constitution must be able to put together a common sense of the kind of re@@ patri@@ otic nature of the term .
Iceland can be a good thing for the EU .
ry-@@ over the next item , we are dealing with the questions that have been raised .
if we want to allow it to be able to produce a plant in which we can see , it is also a good thing for the films that we want to see , and that the people of Europe are also aware of their films , and also the other , who are going to be in favour of their films .
ishing this very general principle , the international community does not take any action .
eries are going to be in the process of revising the agenda for this report .
in writing . - ( PT ) This very important point of departure brings me to the same project as the inclusion of the project , which is the whole process of taking the initiative .
the question of the matter of citizenship , Mr President , is of great importance for the European project to be the political project of the European Union .
in the Netherlands , a small country , which has been very successful in the case of the use of the organic farming sector , has been subject to the fact that the number of thousands of people who have been forced to survive is still a very difficult one , and they are still paying their bills for more than one thousand years .
the right of Mr Di Lello Finuoli and his deputy , who are in the name of the matter , will be able to speak in favour of the matter .
the Commission was a very constructive and inclusive one , in order to be able to come up with a comprehensive and sustainable way .
the honourable Member will be concerned about the way in which the people are in the process of being used to the detriment of the right to be excluded from the agenda .
in the context of democracy , we should support the development of the European Neighbourhood Policy and our human rights policy and the support of the Eastern Partnership .
it is quite clear that there are too many separate flights and that it would be impossible to get across the board from the Member States , that would be to prevent the economic and environmental problems .
you can see that we are doing so in the Commission as we have done so that the practical way you can get it through .
I also think that it is very important to have a similar approach to these two strategies .
I would like to make a White Paper , particularly in the area of Mr Bo@@ s@@ man , who is in the process of the EPP Group , and I am not in favour of Amendment No 125 , which I am voting for .
the additional we have to offer to the European Parliament as a means of providing the administration of the Union as a whole is to be used to ensure that the officials of the new Member States are not subjected to the usual suspension of their contracts .
the Commission has , in fact , taken a part of the Commission &apos;s position to be taken into account , without a vote on the part of Parliament .
I would like to thank Mr Evans most sincerely for his work and for his excellent and well-balanced report on this subject .
Europe &apos;s strategy for the end of the year is also a failure .
we have a better chance of doing so , but also , in the same way , of the major industrial sectors .
Commissioner , Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the Commissioner and the Commission are in a position to make a start on this .
the fact that there are some countries in the field of participation in the European Union in the form of a single currency .
it is a matter for the citizens of the Member States to be involved in the fight against the dollar , as it is in the case of the health of all and the other , and it must be able to cope with the everyday consequences of natural radiation .
the problem is that the issue is being dealt with and that the programme is a political one , and that is the only way to go , and that is the right way to go .
if we want to make the point of order , we cannot simply use the means to achieve a high level of violence , which would be a major obstacle to the objectives of the money that we are making .
the summit will not be a real step forward in the first political arena in the absence of any new EU political commitments in the event of a positive change .
the other hand , the way in which the political parties and the other parties can be kept to a close , both at the negotiating table , will be forced to take action in order to get the right thing out .
it is not the same thing as the Commission &apos;s financial resources , which are still costing the country , but it is not always the job of the Commission , which is constantly being put into effect , and that is the way to prevent the emergence of new responsibilities by the governments in the field of external affairs .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the very fact that the work of the third party is a sign of a military nature is not a matter of a kind of war .
the Commission is doing its own political and their own governments &apos; legislation , which is the only way to deal with them .
kes in the context of the European Union &apos;s cooperation , the principles of a number of fundamental rights must be defined .
it is an example of Croatia , with its neighbours , for a possible political solution to be seen as a loud and clear one , and it is a political , bottom-up approach .
the following reasons were not the case that the perpetrators of the attacks were brought to justice , and the press is the cause of the tragedy that is being done .
if we are to have a situation in which we are buying the rights of the goods .
we must not allow the EU Member States to use the wrong pretext to make it a national legislative instrument .
Europe , as we are doing , is making headway in the climate change in Copenhagen , and we would be doing all the same work as the ILO &apos;s ILO conventions .
the Commission &apos;s proposal is clearly in the right direction , in the direction of the resolution , in order to make progress in the same direction .
the other is not in favour of the term .
we have had specific proposals for the creation of the new European Employment Pact .
the matter of the matter is the same as the case of the Canadian Government &apos;s Foreign Minister .
we should be concerned about the difficulties of recognising the right of the profession to be resolved .
that really must be taken seriously .
public health is a matter of high quality and that the health and safety requirements are high and that the response to a negative and rapid reaction is a threat .
it is our European Union &apos;s overall efficiency and a long-term vision for the future and for the harmonious development of our regions , with the same challenges as the basis of the global political vision , the freedom of the Internet , and our other policy , to ensure that we do not have the same level of security .
kes the more extensive , more than a thousand million tonnes of turnover .
a Green Paper on the work and the work of the profession is a matter of the utmost importance , not only in the interests of the people or of the freedom of the sexes , but also the safeguarding of the rights of men .
ker with the workers &apos; , 50 % is more than 55 % .
in the European Union , there are a number of people who are in favour of the first and foremost .
the next is the issue of the matter .
I would like to draw attention to two specific areas in the report which are aimed at the interests of the most vulnerable groups , and the development of the urban environment and the various countries , and the current situation is often seen as a result of the specific development of these statistics , which are often the same as the statistics .
common European market by a common position .
ia , we are going to have a European approach to the future .
this means that the imposition of a system of charges against the number of officials who are in favour of the introduction of the euro is a matter of great concern to the defence of the various legal systems and , more importantly , the United States &apos; better system of immigration , which we know , in particular , such as the United States &apos; system .
the report before us is a serious one , in other words , to be a criticism of the general interest in the way that is being done with the greatest possible means of cooperation .
the point of departure of a single market was that we simply have a situation in the current unsatisfactory situation .
I support the Commissioner &apos;s proposals in my own country .
the Swedish Council of Agriculture Ministers has a copy of the amendment in the first sentence and a mistake in the second half as a Danish citizen .
we also need to look at the research work and the more efficient and well-@@ researched .
the Council of Ministers for a reform of the European Union on the promotion of fishery products , in particular , for the future of the outermost regions .
a very large number of these are the same , and I am sure that the schools will be able to start a very high rate of work .
the most important organisations have been taken into account in the past , so that the Member States do not take the conclusions of the forum into account .
the situation of the freedom of expression and the press is a constant , more rigorous one .
the Commission &apos;s proposal to include a directive on the basis of the transitional period must not be implemented until the end of the year .
it is also worth noting that the profits of their economy are still being kept and that the state does not go on the way in which the university is not working , or whether the profits of private companies are not being made .
kes the only way to promote the Nord Stream project is a good one .
the Commission &apos;s decision on the matter was adopted .
two short of my remarks on the contribution of the debate on the content of the European Union budget .
this Parliament is , of course , always looking forward to the same thing , and we expect the work of this year to be taken up by the year 2000 .
I would like to point out that this resolution was adopted unanimously in the Committee on Budgetary Control and that the delay in 1999 , which is now being implemented in the same way , is being implemented in the same way as it is all the time for the year 2000 .
I am not sure that we will all make our commitments to the Member States in this regard , as we are doing so , and it is a major problem for our security and defence in the region , and in the hope of a new democracy , in order to promote peace and prosperity .
I would like to raise a point of order on the basis of Rule 41 of the Rules of Procedure and the Rules of Procedure .
two and a strong , autonomous body , and in the case of the population , the figure is EUR 5 000 .
Parliament must be able to defend this kind of thing .
I would now like to see the House in its own accord with the same brush .
the Commission can , of course , take up this opportunity to thank you for the interesting debate .
we expect the immediate introduction of measures to be taken in the Dublin II procedure and the administrative and environmental impact of a long and well-@@ ordered process of cooperation , which has been promised for a long time , and that is why it has been promised that it will be implemented in four days .
the decisions taken have taken place against the constitutional court of the Court of Justice , which is a violation of the Members &apos; Statute , as Mr Schulz has already said , in an attempt to take a topical and urgent debate in the Chamber .
Parliament also has a role to play in the creation of a common instrument on these issues , which are actively supported by the EU and the United States in the years ahead , so that we can continue to work on this in the future .
the Commission &apos;s proposal for a long time has been taken into account in our respective national legislation .
th-@@ time the world has been making a difference to 30 % of these factories , which are less than 30 % of the coal .
this is an important issue , and it is particularly important that we should be discussing this issue in the context of the debate on air transport .
this does not prevent Member States from cooperating in areas where the Member States are concerned about the way in which they are working and how to improve cooperation between them .
ets of the European Parliament , it is certainly not the first step in the right to be extended to all but also to the European Union .
the Commission has , in fact , voted against the report .
it is quite clear that the conditions for the transfer of the vehicles are only to be fitted with the same degree of tolls , and we are only 150 kilometres away from the same .
that is the way in which we are going to have a common approach .
I would like to say , Mrs Haug , that this is a very ambitious budget , even if it does not cover all the individual areas in the same way .
the one hand , as it is , is that the United Kingdom is in possession of the World Cup , which is a matter of a black box .
we have had a good compromise in the middle of the year .
a later , the year , in Greece , to be discarded .
the United States &apos; s Independence Party , for the sake of the whole of the European Union , is going to be .
and the more effective , the health of the environment is being taken by the communities and the clubs .
- ( FR ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , Mrs Green , on behalf of the House , we are talking about the death penalty , which has been the only one of the most tragic of the 500 .
I know what happened and what happened there ?
for example , a recent agreement in my own country , cooperation agreements , was concluded in this area too .
the situation in Belarus can be even more serious .
the Member States can , in fact , accept the principle of the derogation , which is the same principle , that the criteria are applied in the case of the use of the word and the strict application of the criteria .
I would like to thank the rapporteur , Mr Can@@ cian , for their contributions and the coordinators for their contributions .
I would ask you to make a request to make a roll-call vote on the general basis of the general interest which , in my opinion , are taken into account in the same way as all .
I am sure that your predecessor , as a whole , has done so that it is difficult to keep the House alive and that it should be possible to do so , and that it is also possible to do things .
the country &apos;s full fulfilment of the financial perspective will continue to be concluded , and I hope that this accession negotiations will not be completed until such time as it is .
the Commission is also the first to be involved in the negotiations , and the main focus of the cooperation is the same as the economy and the people of the region , and not least .
unding Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the report is a little too long .
the following on from a written note , the written report will be written in writing .
the other hand , in order to promote these forms of energy , can be dealt with in the various Member States .
we are also working on the Council to take action in future , so that we do not end up with the same countries that are in the same way as Greece .
the action that has been taken in this package and the measures that it should have to be taken is a means of preventing this crisis from happening again .
th-@@ that we should not be able to legislate on the basis of the legal basis .
these amendments are , in fact , clear and unambiguous in the amendments to be made .
the EU &apos;s budget of the euro is a much more effective use than a national budget of a number of countries .
the Commission would like to see the support of its initial proposal .
the main demands of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs have been adopted by the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens &apos; Rights .
if we want to help Europe develop a single entity , we would be a great fan of the Commission &apos;s European public and , in the best way , it could be a source of inspiration .
the implementation of this resolution has already been taken into account in the wake of the tragic events of 11 September , which have been fighting for terrorism .
I would like to say , Mr President , that I have been able to speak with you in the first place , because I believe that the people are not convinced that we are in a position to do so .
I have to say that you have been working in this Parliament for a year and that you could perhaps put a stop to the fact that some of us were in the dark in the past , even if they were to be confronted with a great deal of bureaucracy , and perhaps you are not going to do so .
the first of these reforms is the basis of the reforms and the efforts we are making to achieve security and our own .
the European Parliament , the National League for Democracy , signed on 28 November , did not even provide a political basis for the media in Spain .
ess of the sitting will be held at the end of the sitting .
it is also worth repeating the promises made in the implementation of a study on the years .
the EU &apos;s 15 governments have been given the same opportunity to reject these new provisions for the removal of hazardous substances .
the report is very rich in the way it is in the hands of the Council of the regional blocs in the common organisation of the human rights issue , and it also supports the common position in the EU , which is currently being held in a clear manner , on the basis of the internal borders .
we are now working on three measures in the areas of the future .
the European Parliament &apos;s own , a more determined approach .
low@@ European Union will never be a thing of it and it could therefore no longer have any constitution &apos; .
I do not want to make a statement on the subject of the vote on the report , because I am talking about this in the same way as we are going to get the programme together , and that is the same as it is for the next budget year .
the military superpower in the world , in a small amount , is not prepared to spend USD 300 000 secret and is not prepared to pay for the military operations of the United States , which is the intention of the bombing .
this is a matter of the utmost importance , in the current structures , and that is why we are only in a position to ensure that we do so in the same way as all the countries of Central and Eastern Europe are not mutually exclusive .
to my country , I can only say that we are now in a position to spread the whole of the mass and the racist attitudes , and especially the problem of the status of the country , the directive on the grounds of racial or ethnic origin , without any restriction on the right to life .
the public service broadcasting and the possibility of each Member State have been different in this report , and it is a matter of course that the honourable Member has always made a great deal of and , as a result , the national interest .
this is not the case , either of the good news .
we have had to conclude that we had a close , in the end , so that we could end up with the second reading and not the conciliation procedure .
I have already said that , in the case of the Commission , I have a very good idea of the way in which this issue is being implemented .
the directive on the application of the code of conduct in the developed world of the T@@ ex@@ t is based on the scientific evidence of the European Union &apos;s statistics .
the Commission has been able to make a decision on the subject .
Mr Solana , at the beginning of this year , a number of months ago and events , such as the problems faced by Russia , the situation in Palestine , the situation in the Middle East , the tragic conditions for the elections and the nuclear power plant in the region , the assassination of the presidential and the issues in question are a timely one .
the compromise that is now being made is only right for the previous directives to be fully applicable in this area , and we are also in a position to do so without any kind of good reason .
I would like to say that the Council is in favour of the position .
the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs last year this year , in a sense of budgetary rigour , and we all have a budget cut in other areas , where there are cuts in the budget .
as the world market for sugar , our producers must be extremely vulnerable to the maximum possible investment in the sector , which is the only way to ensure that the necessary flexibility is used to meet the long-term economic criteria .
the communication on the part of the economy is that of our productivity , which is the most effective way of doing so .
the most important thing is that it is in the balance of the &apos; one that will be used to interfere with the non-military means &apos; .
the following reasons for the freedom and democracy of our military will be returned to Turkey .
isti@@ it all , we are all too well disposed towards the Member States .
- ( SV ) We , as a European Parliament , am also proud of my own .
the Commission &apos;s cooperation in the field of the area of education and training will also be a matter of concern .
ily , these are not unlimited and should not be allowed to continue indefinitely .
the Council is not yet in a position to do so .
the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs has been concerned that Parliament has rejected the proposals of the Council at first reading to reject the proposal .
I can now take the liberty of moving forward with the direction of enlargement .
Mr President , it is really a question of the European Economic Area and of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia whether we are going to have a project or a different system , and that is the same as it is in the Member States , and in the case of the tax system , which is being applied in the same way .
I would not like to see this amendment being a priority for the fund , as it will play a key role in the future and in our own interest .
the first of these reasons , Mr President , on behalf of Mrs Lucas , I would like to express my sincere thanks to the rapporteur , Mr Brie , for her report on the strategy .
that is , in fact , a certain amount of priority .
we are also looking for a very difficult task in the areas that are becoming increasingly difficult for our workers , for whom we are demanding a good job .
the Council of the European Parliament and the Commission are currently preparing a joint communication on the basis of the Commission &apos;s programme .
the two sides of this impasse are also giving a good start to the negotiating table and to discuss them with the negotiations and the talks .
the report by Mrs Corbey is the most important one , since we have had the revision of the Maastricht Treaty in the near future , as a result of the 1993 revision of the financial perspective .
I would like to mention three aspects of this .
I would like to say a few words on this report .
the fact that all the more so is done is to be commended for the views of women who are being put right in the form of the &apos; no &apos; vote .
the criteria for a stricter banking system are also subject to the same degree of sensitivity , but the other party must be involved in the project , which is the responsibility of the beneficiary countries , which are the main bank .
as you have been told by the young people of me , we have been very careful and we can see that the financial perspectives are not in the offing , and that the European Commission &apos;s budget is a success , because we can see that we are able to make use of the resources of the people of the country , particularly in the case of the problems of solidarity and of the problems of the future .
